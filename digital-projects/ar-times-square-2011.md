# 2011 – *Augmented Reality Advertising Takeover* (Times Square)

**Year:** 2011 (July 24, 2011)  
**Platform:** Public Ad Campaign × The Heavy Projects  
**Type:** Augmented reality public-art intervention

## Overview

The **Augmented Reality Advertising Takeover** transformed Times Square’s dense field of corporate billboards into a massive digital canvas for independent artists—visible only through mobile AR apps. Organized by **Public Ad Campaign** and **The Heavy Projects**, it replaced commercial advertisements with virtual artworks to critique advertising saturation in public space.

Ron English contributed digitally overlaid pieces that echoed his long-running themes of media distortion, consumer manipulation, and pop-culture parody. The project became an early example of AR activism, foreshadowing the later rise of metaverse art and location-based digital installations.

The event also demonstrated how artists could temporarily “reclaim” heavily commercialized environments without physically altering them—a key early moment in the evolution of mixed-reality street art.
