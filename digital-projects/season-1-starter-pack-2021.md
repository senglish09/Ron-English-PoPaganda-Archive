# 2021 – *Season 1 Starter Pack*

## Overview

Superchief Gallery launched the **world’s first physical NFT gallery space** in New York with the *Season 1 Starter Pack*, a foundational release that set the tone for its hybrid digital-physical program. The exhibition introduced a lineup of early NFT artists alongside notable figures such as Ron English, marking his official participation in the gallery’s first wave.

The Starter Pack functioned as a proof-of-concept for Superchief’s mission: showcasing digital artworks on large-scale screens, hosting live events, and blending crypto-culture with the gallery world. English’s presence placed Popaganda at the center of this pioneering moment, reinforcing his role as one of the first established contemporary artists to embrace NFTs at a gallery level.

This drop is often referenced in early NFT press as a milestone in the legitimization of NFTs within traditional art-world spaces.
