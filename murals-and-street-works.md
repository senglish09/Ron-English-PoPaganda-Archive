| 1989 | Early November 1989 (week before the fall of the Wall) | Berlin Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, West Berlin, West Germany | Checkpoint Charlie mural (“Peace on Earth”) | Painting on the western side of the Berlin Wall days before its collapse, English worked so close to the border that East German guards tried to grab him while nearby refugees shouted warnings. The week-long, unauthorized “Peace on Earth” mural became one of the most documented pieces at Checkpoint Charlie; surviving photographs, film footage, and a postcard dated 12 November 1989 continue to anchor its place in early activist street-art history. **[Images ↓](#berlin-wall-1989)** | [ILoveGraffiti](https://ilovegraffiti.de/blog/2009/11/10/ron-english-am-checkpoint-charlie-1989/) <br> [The Rumpus](https://therumpus.net/2009/11/09/ron-english-remembers-the-berlin-wall-1989/) <br> [Pond5](https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/item/10920270-west-berlin-west-germany-1988-berlin-wall-graffiti-art-bulld?dd_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) <br> [Stiftung Berliner Mauer](https://sammlung.stiftung-berliner-mauer.de/Result?sId=605&pId=13670919&sw=Postkarte&page=1&list=0&k=WEB_0405&sort=DatumAsc&smode=And&collectionTitel=Themen&collectionSubTitel=Mauerkunst&pageSize=16) <br> [Poiein Kai Prattein](http://poieinkaiprattein.org/beyond-images/photography/kuzdas/exhibition-at-goethe-in-athens/index.htm) <br> [Festival of Lights Magazine](https://magazin-festival-of-lights.de/en/berliner-mauer-kunst) |
| 2008 | December 2008 (Art Basel Miami week) | Wynwood streets (Primary Flight), Miami, Florida, US | Primary Flight mural | The second edition of Primary Flight turned Wynwood’s warehouses into a mapped open-air exhibition during Art Basel Miami Beach, and English’s wall quickly joined the neighborhood’s formative wave of large-scale murals. Curators BooksIIII, Lynn Yohana Howard, Logan Hicks, and Anthony Spinello shaped the project into an early blueprint for Wynwood’s international street-art identity. **[Images ↓](#primary-flight-2008)** | [Cool Hunting](https://coolhunting.com/culture/2008-art-basel/) <br> [Marc Woehr](https://marcwoehr.com/project/art-basel-miami-2008-wynwood-art-district/) <br> [Art Crimes – 2008 archive](https://ftp.icm.edu.pl/packages/graffiti.old/index/history2008.html) <br> [Arrested Motion](https://arrestedmotion.com/2009/12/basel-week-miami-09-ron-english-primary-flight-mural/) <br> [Designboom (general Primary Flight coverage)](https://www.designboom.com/art/primary-flight-at-art-basel-miami-12-05-08/) <br> [Junta de Andalucía – Primary Flight resource](https://edea.juntadeandalucia.es/bancorecursos/items/a3d927ad-142d-40f6-9fe5-a18c40806da8/1/viewscorm.jsp?.vi=file) |
| 2010 | November 29 – December 5, 2010 | Wynwood (Primary Flight / Contra Projects), Miami, Florida, US | Contra Projects at Primary Flight | As Art Basel Miami Beach opened its 2010 edition, Contra Projects joined forces with Primary Flight to activate Wynwood with a dense grid of murals, installations, and street interventions. English contributed as part of this collaborative push, appearing in coverage from Primary Flight’s official listings and Brooklyn Street Art’s Contra Projects archive, which documented the cross-pollination between international street artists and Wynwood’s rapidly expanding outdoor wall network. **[Images ↓](#contra-projects-primary-flight-2010)** | [Soul of Miami – Primary Flight 2010](https://www.soulofmiami.org/2010/11/08/primary-flight-street-art-murals-1129-12510/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – Contra Projects](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/tag/contraprojects/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – Primary Flight archive](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/category/primary-flight/) |
| 2012 | November 2012 (New York Comedy Festival) | Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, New York, US | Temper Tot (green version) | Installed during Vandalog’s *Art of Comedy* program, the original green Temper Tot marked one of the earliest POPaganda anchors in the L.I.S.A. Project’s effort to revive Little Italy through curated murals. The piece stood out immediately—an oversized, brooding baby Hulk towering above Mulberry Street—setting the stage for later expansions of the block into a formal street-art corridor. **[Images ↓](#temper-tot-little-italy-2012)** | [Vandalog – Temper Tot (2012)](https://blog.vandalog.com/2012/11/05/ron-englishs-temper-tot-in-little-italy/) <br> [Flickr – Temper Tot 2012](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/8321047215) <br> [Thom Bradley – Little Italy Murals](https://thombradley.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/nyc-little-italy-murals/) |
| 2015 | August 5–9, 2015 (LoMan Arts Festival) | Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, New York, US | Temper Tot (pink LoMan version) | For the first LoMan Arts Festival, English returned to Mulberry Street and reimagined his signature character as a vivid pink Temper Tot towering over the block. The update transformed a well-known POPaganda landmark into a new festival centerpiece, and coverage from StreetArtNews, Viewing NYC, and Brooklyn Street Art emphasized how the refreshed mural helped establish LoMan as Lower Manhattan’s inaugural large-scale mural festival. **[Images ↓](#temper-tot-little-italy-2015)** | [StreetArtNews – New Temper Tot (2015)](https://streetartnews.net/2015/07/ron-english-temper-tot-new-piece-in.html) <br> [Viewing NYC – Pink Temper Tot](https://viewing.nyc/street-artist-ron-english-puts-up-a-new-temper-tot-in-little-italy/) <br> [Dreamstime – Pink Temper Tot Editorial](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-new-giant-pink-temper-tot-mural-ron-english-little-italy-manhattan-york-august-image57808983) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – LoMan Festival](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2015/08/12/lomanart-festival-launches-its-first-blast-in-nyc/) <br> [NY1 Spectrum – LoMan Mural Festival](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/08/5/mural-art-festival-hopes-to-leave-big-mark-on-lower-manhattan) <br> [UrbanArtNow – Purple/Pink Hulk Baby](https://www.tumblr.com/urbanartnow/125840866228/the-purple-hulk-baby-mural-by-ron-english) |
| 2017 | March 2017 | Troutman Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York, US | Trumpty Dumpty | Painted on a Bushwick wall during the early months of the Trump presidency, *Trumpty Dumpty* quickly became one of English’s most circulated political murals. The piece reimagines Humpty Dumpty as a caricatured Trump figure perched on a cracked wall—a satirical visual that drew global attention and appeared in street-art roundups from New York to Australia. Photo archives from March 2017 confirm its placement along Troutman Street, a corridor known for large-scale political murals. **[Images ↓](#trumpty-dumpty-2017)** | [Dreamstime – Bushwick Trumpty Dumpty](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-mural-art-depicting-donald-trump-troutman-street-brooklyn-new-york-march-outdoor-gallery-known-as-bushwick-image89349508) <br> [Jacqueline Mahadel – Bushwick Street Art](https://jacquelinemhadel.com/2017/03/22/brooklyn-new-york-street-art-trumpty-dumpty-by-ron-english/) <br> [Google Street Art – Twitter archive](https://x.com/googlestreetart/status/822489895096713217) <br> [Canberra Times – Trump Art Article](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6047759/gang-gang-street-art-humpty-trumpty-has-a-great-fall/) <br> [Arrested Motion – Streets World Roundup](https://arrestedmotion.com/2016/07/streets-world-roundup-feb-21-july-10/) <br> [I Support Street Art – Trump Walls](https://www.isupportstreetart.com/trump-street-art-walls-say/) <br> [Barbara Picci – Bushwick Coverage](https://barbarapicci.com/2016/06/30/ron-english-bushwick-brooklyn/) |
| 2017 | June 8–18, 2017 | Boulevard Saint-Laurent (MURAL Festival), Montreal, Quebec, Canada | Sourire Mona Lisa | English headlined Montréal’s 2017 MURAL Festival with an outdoor wall featuring his “Sourire Mona Lisa,” a POPaganda remix blending classical portraiture with his signature surreal twists. Installed along the festival’s main corridor on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, the piece became one of the edition’s most photographed works and appeared across Canadian arts coverage and international street-art roundups. **[Images ↓](#mural-festival-2017-montreal)** | [MURAL Festival – Official Archive](https://muralfestival.com/artwork/ron-english-2017-2/) <br> [Cultura Inquieta – Festival Highlights](https://culturainquieta.com/arte/arte-urbano/el-mural-festival-de-montreal-ha-vuelto-a-dejarnos-impresionantes-obras-de-arte-urbano/) <br> [Journal Metro Montréal – Festival Program](https://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/1140830/le-festival-mural-devoile-sa-programmation/) <br> [StreetArt360 – Festival Recap](https://streetart360.net/2017/06/19/montreal-mural-festival-street-art/) |
| 2017 | September 13, 2017 | Schöneberg (Urban Nation / ONE WALL), Berlin, Germany | ONE WALL (Urban Nation Museum mural) | Created for Urban Nation’s inaugural ONE WALL program, this large-format mural was installed during the museum’s opening season as part of its permanent outdoor collection. English’s contribution stood out among the launch lineup, echoing the museum’s mission to treat Berlin’s façades as an open gallery and marking his role in a global roster assembled for the institution’s debut. **[Images ↓](#one-wall-2017)** | [Urban Nation – ONE WALL Announcement](https://urban-nation.com/2017/09/one-wall-von-ron-english/) <br> [Urban Nation – Artist Profile](https://urban-nation.com/artist/ron-english/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – Urban Nation Opening](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2017/09/page/2/) |
| 2017 | October 2017 | 1st Avenue at St. Marks Place, Manhattan, New York, US | Manhattan Runners | Painted along the route of the TCS NYC Marathon, this mural turned a stretch of 1st Avenue into part art-installation, part public tribute: runners and passers-by could see English’s work as they passed the cheering wall. The piece gained visibility via the marathon’s official mural program, giving public-art fans a rare chance to engage with street art tied to an iconic urban event. **[Images ↓](#manhattan-runners-2017)** | [Women’s Running – NYC Marathon Murals](https://www.womensrunning.com/culture/murals-5-boroughs-celebrate-nyc-marathon/) |
| 2018 | December 2018 (Art Basel Miami Beach week) | Wynwood Walls (citywide programming), Miami, Florida, US | Wynwood Walls – Basel Week murals | During Miami Art Week 2018, Wynwood Walls expanded its yearly Basel-week programming with live painting and a globally mixed roster. English added new POPaganda imagery to the complex, highlighted in coverage from SprayPlanet, World Red Eye, and Hypebeast, which noted how established muralists and emerging international artists converged to reshape the district’s visual momentum. **[Images ↓](#wynwood-2018)** | [SprayPlanet – Art Basel Recap](https://www.sprayplanet.com/blogs/news/spray-planet-s-official-art-basel-miami-2018-recap) <br> [World Red Eye – Wynwood Walls VIP Dinner](https://worldredeye.com/2018/12/wynwood-walls-vip-dinner-party/) <br> [Hypebeast – Wynwood Walls Programming](https://hypebeast.com/2018/11/wynwood-walls-art-basel-2018-vhils-programming) <br> [SprayPlanet (duplicate link)](https://www.sprayplanet.com/blogs/news/spray-planet-s-official-art-basel-miami-2018-recap) |
| 2019 | 2019 (approx.) | Lyon, France | Elefanka | One of the most recognizable additions to Lyon’s growing roster of XXL murals, *Elefanka* brings English’s hybrid-animal surrealism into the French street-art scene. The piece appears across multiple Lyon mural guides and walking circuits, where it’s highlighted as an unexpected POPaganda presence among the city’s large-format façades. Local documentation from 2019–2020 confirms the work as a standout destination for mural hunters exploring the neighborhood’s evolving urban-art landscape. **[Images ↓](#elefanka-lyon-2019)** | [CanalBlog – Ron English à Lyon](https://ptitloley.canalblog.com/archives/2019/11/06/37767436.html) <br> [Street Art Safari – Elefanka](https://www.street-art-safari.com/Picture@1120%E2%9C%AA) <br> [Bleu Saturne – Balade Street Art Lyon](https://bleusaturne.wordpress.com/2020/01/23/balade-street-art-lyon/) <br> [Lucky Sophie – Murs XXL à Lyon](https://www.luckysophie.com/2023/01/street-art-murs-xxl-a-lyon.html) |

Event recaps emphasized how his POPaganda aesthetic stood out within a program designed to position Jersey City as a growing East Coast hub for large-scale public art. **[Images ↓](#jersey-city-2021)** | [Hoboken Girl](https://www.hobokengirl.com/jersey-city-mural-festival-2021/) <br> [Jersey City Mural Festival](https://jerseycitymuralfestival.com/artist/ron-english/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2021/06/10/community-and-street-aesthetics-popping-at-jersey-city-mural-festival-2021/) <br> [Everything Jersey City](https://everythingjerseycity.com/jersey-city-mural-arts-festival-recap/) <br> [Mad Hatters NYC](https://madhattersnyc.com/blog/best-jersey-city-street-art-murals-graffiti) <br> [JC Mural Arts Map](https://www.jcmap.org/our-murals?mural=5d84f300a524ed46c578619b) <br> [NJCU – Mural Arts Project](https://www.njcu.edu/about/why-njcu/game-changer/our-city/jersey-city-mural-arts-project-sponsorship) <br> [NJ.com](https://www.nj.com/hudson/2019/08/world-renowned-street-artist-ron-english-brings-his-popaganda-to-jersey-city-photos.html) |
