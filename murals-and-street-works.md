| 1989 | Early November 1989 (week before the fall of the Wall) | Berlin Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, West Berlin, West Germany | Checkpoint Charlie mural (“Peace on Earth”) | Painting on the western side of the Berlin Wall days before its collapse, English worked so close to the border that East German guards tried to grab him while nearby refugees shouted warnings. The week-long, unauthorized “Peace on Earth” mural became one of the most documented pieces at Checkpoint Charlie; surviving photographs, film footage, and a postcard dated 12 November 1989 continue to anchor its place in early activist street-art history. **[Images ↓](#berlin-wall-1989)** | [ILoveGraffiti](https://ilovegraffiti.de/blog/2009/11/10/ron-english-am-checkpoint-charlie-1989/) <br> [The Rumpus](https://therumpus.net/2009/11/09/ron-english-remembers-the-berlin-wall-1989/) <br> [Pond5](https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/item/10920270-west-berlin-west-germany-1988-berlin-wall-graffiti-art-bulld?dd_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) <br> [Stiftung Berliner Mauer](https://sammlung.stiftung-berliner-mauer.de/Result?sId=605&pId=13670919&sw=Postkarte&page=1&list=0&k=WEB_0405&sort=DatumAsc&smode=And&collectionTitel=Themen&collectionSubTitel=Mauerkunst&pageSize=16) <br> [Poiein Kai Prattein](http://poieinkaiprattein.org/beyond-images/photography/kuzdas/exhibition-at-goethe-in-athens/index.htm) <br> [Festival of Lights Magazine](https://magazin-festival-of-lights.de/en/berliner-mauer-kunst) |
| 2008 | December 2008 (Art Basel Miami week) | Wynwood streets (Primary Flight), Miami, Florida, US | Primary Flight mural | The second edition of Primary Flight turned Wynwood’s warehouses into a mapped open-air exhibition during Art Basel Miami Beach, and English’s wall quickly joined the neighborhood’s formative wave of large-scale murals. Curators BooksIIII, Lynn Yohana Howard, Logan Hicks, and Anthony Spinello shaped the project into an early blueprint for Wynwood’s international street-art identity. **[Images ↓](#primary-flight-2008)** | [Cool Hunting](https://coolhunting.com/culture/2008-art-basel/) <br> [Marc Woehr](https://marcwoehr.com/project/art-basel-miami-2008-wynwood-art-district/) <br> [Art Crimes – 2008 archive](https://ftp.icm.edu.pl/packages/graffiti.old/index/history2008.html) <br> [Arrested Motion](https://arrestedmotion.com/2009/12/basel-week-miami-09-ron-english-primary-flight-mural/) <br> [Designboom (general Primary Flight coverage)](https://www.designboom.com/art/primary-flight-at-art-basel-miami-12-05-08/) <br> [Junta de Andalucía – Primary Flight resource](https://edea.juntadeandalucia.es/bancorecursos/items/a3d927ad-142d-40f6-9fe5-a18c40806da8/1/viewscorm.jsp?.vi=file) |
| 2012 | November 2012 (New York Comedy Festival) | Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, New York, US | Temper Tot (green version) | Installed during Vandalog’s *Art of Comedy* program, the original green Temper Tot marked one of the earliest POPaganda anchors in the L.I.S.A. Project’s effort to revive Little Italy through curated murals. The piece stood out immediately—an oversized, brooding baby Hulk towering above Mulberry Street—setting the stage for later expansions of the block into a formal street-art corridor. **[Images ↓](#temper-tot-little-italy-2012)** | [Vandalog – Temper Tot (2012)](https://blog.vandalog.com/2012/11/05/ron-englishs-temper-tot-in-little-italy/) <br> [Flickr – Temper Tot 2012](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/8321047215) <br> [Thom Bradley – Little Italy Murals](https://thombradley.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/nyc-little-italy-murals/) |
| 2015 | August 5–9, 2015 (LoMan Arts Festival) | Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, New York, US | Temper Tot (pink LoMan version) | For the first LoMan Arts Festival, English returned to Mulberry Street and reimagined his signature character as a vivid pink Temper Tot towering over the block. The update transformed a well-known POPaganda landmark into a new festival centerpiece, and coverage from StreetArtNews, Viewing NYC, and Brooklyn Street Art emphasized how the refreshed mural helped establish LoMan as Lower Manhattan’s inaugural large-scale mural festival. **[Images ↓](#temper-tot-little-italy-2015)** | [StreetArtNews – New Temper Tot (2015)](https://streetartnews.net/2015/07/ron-english-temper-tot-new-piece-in.html) <br> [Viewing NYC – Pink Temper Tot](https://viewing.nyc/street-artist-ron-english-puts-up-a-new-temper-tot-in-little-italy/) <br> [Dreamstime – Pink Temper Tot Editorial](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-new-giant-pink-temper-tot-mural-ron-english-little-italy-manhattan-york-august-image57808983) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – LoMan Festival](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2015/08/12/lomanart-festival-launches-its-first-blast-in-nyc/) <br> [NY1 Spectrum – LoMan Mural Festival](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/08/5/mural-art-festival-hopes-to-leave-big-mark-on-lower-manhattan) <br> [UrbanArtNow – Purple/Pink Hulk Baby](https://www.tumblr.com/urbanartnow/125840866228/the-purple-hulk-baby-mural-by-ron-english) |
| 2018 | December 2018 (Art Basel Miami Beach week) | Wynwood Walls (citywide programming), Miami, Florida, US | Wynwood Walls – Basel Week murals | During Miami Art Week 2018, Wynwood Walls expanded its yearly Basel-week programming with live painting and a globally mixed roster. English added new POPaganda imagery to the complex, highlighted in coverage from SprayPlanet, World Red Eye, and Hypebeast, which noted how established muralists and emerging international artists converged to reshape the district’s visual momentum. **[Images ↓](#wynwood-2018)** | [SprayPlanet – Art Basel Recap](https://www.sprayplanet.com/blogs/news/spray-planet-s-official-art-basel-miami-2018-recap) <br> [World Red Eye – Wynwood Walls VIP Dinner](https://worldredeye.com/2018/12/wynwood-walls-vip-dinner-party/) <br> [Hypebeast – Wynwood Walls Programming](https://hypebeast.com/2018/11/wynwood-walls-art-basel-2018-vhils-programming) <br> [SprayPlanet (duplicate link)](https://www.sprayplanet.com/blogs/news/spray-planet-s-official-art-basel-miami-2018-recap) |
| 2021 | June 5–6, 2021 | Jersey City Mural Festival, Jersey City, New Jersey, US | Jersey City Mural Festival mural | Journal Square and Hamilton Park became a two-day street-art circuit for the first-ever Jersey City Mural Festival, where English appeared among a lineup blending local creators with well-known international names. Event recaps emphasized how his POPaganda aesthetic stood out within a program designed to position Jersey City as a growing East Coast hub for large-scale public art. **[Images ↓](#jersey-city-2021)** | [Hoboken Girl](https://www.hobokengirl.com/jersey-city-mural-festival-2021/) <br> [Jersey City Mural Festival](https://jerseycitymuralfestival.com/artist/ron-english/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2021/06/10/community-and-street-aesthetics-popping-at-jersey-city-mural-festival-2021/) <br> [Everything Jersey City](https://everythingjerseycity.com/jersey-city-mural-arts-festival-recap/) <br> [Mad Hatters NYC](https://madhattersnyc.com/blog/best-jersey-city-street-art-murals-graffiti) <br> [JC Mural Arts Map](https://www.jcmap.org/our-murals?mural=5d84f300a524ed46c578619b) <br> [NJCU – Mural Arts Project](https://www.njcu.edu/about/why-njcu/game-changer/our-city/jersey-city-mural-arts-project-sponsorship) <br> [NJ.com](https://www.nj.com/hudson/2019/08/world-renowned-street-artist-ron-english-brings-his-popaganda-to-jersey-city-photos.html) |
| 2022 | November 2022 | Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas, US | Texas Tantrum Trots and Pals | Installed in the heart of Deep Ellum’s arts district, *Texas Tantrum Trots and Pals* marked English’s return to Texas with one of the neighborhood’s most flamboyant recent murals. The piece blends POPaganda characters with Texas-themed surrealism, adding to Deep Ellum’s tradition of loud, maximalist walls. Coverage from D Magazine and StreetArtCities highlights how the mural immediately became a landmark within the district’s revitalized public-art scene. **[Images ↓](#texas-tantrum-trots-and-pals)** | [Reddit – Deep Ellum Mural](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATBGE/comments/12ol6oi/this_mural_to_keep_the_arts_district_weird/) <br> [Dreamstime – Texas Tantrum Trots and Pals](https://www.dreamstime.com/mural-titled-texas-tantrum-trots-pals-ron-english-deep-ellum-east-dallas-texas-pictured-mural-titled-texas-image262664464) <br> [D Magazine – Ron English Returns to Dallas](https://www.dmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2022/11/legendary-graffiti-artist-ron-english-comes-home-to-deep-ellum-with-a-new-mural/) <br> [StreetArtCities – Mural Marker](https://streetartcities.com/markers/4f8a47dd-06de-47c4-9fb2-e40d9149f5fa) <br> [CultureMap Dallas – Deep Ellum Art](https://dallas.culturemap.com/news/arts/deep-ellum-mural-ron-english/) |
