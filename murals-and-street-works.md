| 1989 | Early November 1989 (week before the fall of the Wall) | Berlin Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, West Berlin, West Germany | Checkpoint Charlie mural (“Peace on Earth”) | Painting on the western side of the Berlin Wall days before its collapse, English worked so close to the border that East German guards tried to grab him while nearby refugees shouted warnings. The week-long, unauthorized “Peace on Earth” mural became one of the most documented pieces at Checkpoint Charlie; surviving photographs, film footage, and a postcard dated 12 November 1989 continue to anchor its place in early activist street-art history. **[Images ↓](#berlin-wall-1989)** | [ILoveGraffiti](https://ilovegraffiti.de/blog/2009/11/10/ron-english-am-checkpoint-charlie-1989/) <br> [The Rumpus](https://therumpus.net/2009/11/09/ron-english-remembers-the-berlin-wall-1989/) <br> [Pond5](https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/item/10920270-west-berlin-west-germany-1988-berlin-wall-graffiti-art-bulld?dd_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) <br> [Stiftung Berliner Mauer](https://sammlung.stiftung-berliner-mauer.de/Result?sId=605&pId=13670919&sw=Postkarte&page=1&list=0&k=WEB_0405&sort=DatumAsc&smode=And&collectionTitel=Themen&collectionSubTitel=Mauerkunst&pageSize=16) <br> [Poiein Kai Prattein](http://poieinkaiprattein.org/beyond-images/photography/kuzdas/exhibition-at-goethe-in-athens/index.htm) <br> [Festival of Lights Magazine](https://magazin-festival-of-lights.de/en/berliner-mauer-kunst) |
| 2008 | December 2008 (Art Basel Miami week) | Wynwood streets (Primary Flight), Miami, Florida, US | Primary Flight mural | The second edition of Primary Flight turned Wynwood’s warehouses into a mapped open-air exhibition during Art Basel Miami Beach, and English’s wall quickly joined the neighborhood’s formative wave of large-scale murals. Curators BooksIIII, Lynn Yohana Howard, Logan Hicks, and Anthony Spinello shaped the project into an early blueprint for Wynwood’s international street-art identity. **[Images ↓](#primary-flight-2008)** | [Cool Hunting](https://coolhunting.com/culture/2008-art-basel/) <br> [Marc Woehr](https://marcwoehr.com/project/art-basel-miami-2008-wynwood-art-district/) <br> [Art Crimes – 2008 archive](https://ftp.icm.edu.pl/packages/graffiti.old/index/history2008.html) <br> [Arrested Motion](https://arrestedmotion.com/2009/12/basel-week-miami-09-ron-english-primary-flight-mural/) <br> [Designboom (general Primary Flight coverage)](https://www.designboom.com/art/primary-flight-at-art-basel-miami-12-05-08/) <br> [Junta de Andalucía – Primary Flight resource](https://edea.juntadeandalucia.es/bancorecursos/items/a3d927ad-142d-40f6-9fe5-a18c40806da8/1/viewscorm.jsp?.vi=file) |
| 2010 | 2010 (Los Angeles Freewalls era) | Los Angeles Arts District, Los Angeles, California, US | Urban Bigfoot (LA Freewalls) | One of the most recognizable works from the early **LA Freewalls** initiative, English’s towering “Urban Bigfoot” fused his POPaganda surrealism with West Coast street-art energy. Installed in the rapidly growing Arts District, the mural became a magnet for photographers and was repeatedly featured in media discussions about LA’s changing relationship to public art. Coverage from LA Taco, Clutter Magazine, and PBS SoCal highlights how the piece helped cement Freewalls as a pivotal moment in the city’s transition from industrial zone to street-art destination. **[Images ↓](#urban-bigfoot-la)** | [Flickr – keysflyingatme](https://www.flickr.com/photos/keysflyingatme/with/5293488135) <br> [PBS SoCal – Mural Politics](https://www.pbssocal.org/history-society/mural-citations-are-off-the-wall-politics) <br> [HuffPost – Street Art](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/street-art-its-not-meant_b_5610496) <br> [LA Taco](https://lataco.com/urban-bigfoot-ron-english-la-freewalls) <br> [Clutter Magazine – Progress Update](https://www.cluttermagazine.com/news/2013/11/progress-ron-englishs-urban-bigfoot-mural-la) <br> [Clutter – Urban Bigfoot tag](https://www.cluttermagazine.com/tags/urban-bigfoot) <br> [Daily Record – Best Pictures](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/gallery/todays-best-pictures-around-globe-3767077) <br> [YouTube – Mural video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA2RbTO0MdM) |
| 2010 | November 29 – December 5, 2010 | Wynwood (Primary Flight / Contra Projects), Miami, Florida, US | Contra Projects at Primary Flight | As Art Basel Miami Beach opened its 2010 edition, Contra Projects joined forces with Primary Flight to activate Wynwood with a dense grid of murals, installations, and street interventions. English contributed as part of this collaborative push, appearing in coverage from Primary Flight’s official listings and Brooklyn Street Art’s Contra Projects archive, which documented the cross-pollination between international street artists and Wynwood’s rapidly expanding outdoor wall network. **[Images ↓](#contra-projects-primary-flight-2010)** | [Soul of Miami – Primary Flight 2010](https://www.soulofmiami.org/2010/11/08/primary-flight-street-art-murals-1129-12510/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – Contra Projects](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/tag/contraprojects/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – Primary Flight archive](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/category/primary-flight/) |
| 2012 | September 2012 | Stavanger (Atlantic Hotel façade), Norway | Nuart Festival mural | As one of the headlining artists of Nuart 2012, English transformed the side of the Atlantic Hotel into a towering tableau of his grinning rabbit figures. The work became one of the most photographed murals of that year’s festival, anchoring Stavanger’s reputation as Europe’s outdoor street-art capital. Coverage in Norwegian press and international street-art media highlights how the mural’s scale and placement turned it into a defining image of the 2012 edition. **[Images ↓](#nuart-2012)** | [Aftenbladet – Rabbits Invade Atlantic Hotel](https://www.aftenbladet.no/kultur/i/djRvO/kaniner-invaderer-atlantic) <br> [Getty Images – Nuart 2012 Mural](https://www.gettyimages.com.mx/detail/fotograf%C3%ADa-de-noticias/mural-by-us-street-artist-ron-english-on-the-fotograf%C3%ADa-de-noticias/848758746) <br> [Aftenbladet – 10 Nuart Works](https://www.aftenbladet.no/aktuelt/i/AdkmXE/10-fantastiske-nuart-kunstverk-vi-nesten-hadde-glemt) <br> [Vandalog – Nuart Outdoor Work](https://blog.vandalog.com/2012/10/22/nuart-part-4-more-outdoor-work/) <br> [StreetArtNews Japan – Nuart 2012](http://www.streetartnewsjapan.com/2012/09/ron-english-in.html) <br> [MarianneRa – Nuart 2012 Photo Post](https://mariannera.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/) |
| 2012 | November 2012 (New York Comedy Festival) | Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, New York, US | Temper Tot (green version) | Installed during Vandalog’s *Art of Comedy* program, the original green Temper Tot marked one of the earliest POPaganda anchors in the L.I.S.A. Project’s effort to revive Little Italy through curated murals. The piece stood out immediately—an oversized, brooding baby Hulk towering above Mulberry Street—setting the stage for later expansions of the block into a formal street-art corridor. **[Images ↓](#temper-tot-little-italy-2012)** | [Vandalog – Temper Tot (2012)](https://blog.vandalog.com/2012/11/05/ron-englishs-temper-tot-in-little-italy/) <br> [Flickr – Temper Tot 2012](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/8321047215) <br> [Thom Bradley – Little Italy Murals](https://thombradley.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/nyc-little-italy-murals/) |
| 2013 | October 2013 | Via dei Pisoni 89, Quadraro, Rome, Italy | Temper Tot & Mousemask Murphy (Quadraro) | Painted for Rome’s open-air M.U.Ro (Museo di Urban Art di Roma) project, this large wall pairs English’s baby Hulk figure Temper Tot with a gas-masked Mickey-type character. Italian press framed the mural as a portrait of a powerful nation with immature leadership, while local guides note how the flat pastel backdrop pushes the two figures forward in almost 3D relief. The wall went on to feature in Sky Arte’s *Muro a Roma* documentary and is now one of Quadraro’s best-known street-art landmarks. **[Images ↓](#mousemask-temper-rome-2013)** | [Repubblica Roma – Ron English al Quadraro](https://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/10/10/news/le_pareti_del_quadraro_per_il_warhol_della_street_art-68269324/) <br> [Repubblica Roma – Galleria fotografica](https://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/10/10/foto/la_street_art_di_ron_english_sulle_pareti_del_quadraro-68267075/) <br> [Ecomuseo Casilino – Ron English, “Senza titolo”](https://www.ecomuseocasilino.it/loc/quadraro-vecchio/page/2/) <br> [M.U.Ro – Press clippings](https://muromuseum.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_12.html) <br> [BLocal Travel – M.U.Ro walking tour](https://www.blocal-travel.com/street-art/the-muro-walking-tour-and-so-im-back-html/) <br> [Minorsights – M.U.Ro Museum of Urban Art](https://www.minorsights.com/2015/01/italy-muro-museum-of-urban-art-in-rome.html) <br> [StreetArtNYC – Rome’s Quadraro neighborhood](https://streetartnyc.org/blog/2015/09/30/street-art-nyc-in-romes-quadrado-neighborhood-with-beau-stanton-dilka-bear-maupal-ron-english-veks-van-hillik-and-mr-thoms/) |
| 2014 | June 2014 (Richmond Mural Project 2014) | 646 N 7th St (wall 2), Richmond, Virginia, US | Grin Baby (Richmond Mural Project) | The 2014 Richmond Mural Project handed English a huge façade at 646 N 7th Street, where he painted an outsized “Grin Baby” head with his trademark skull-toothed smile towering over the street. The official mural map and Street Art Avenue photo set frame it as one of the festival’s landmark pieces, while local photography and RVA Mag coverage show how the wall became a recognizable #richmondmuralproject stop and an early large-scale East Coast showcase for his Grin Baby character. **[Images ↓](#grin-baby-richmond-2014)** | [Richmond Mural Project – Murals](https://richmondmuralproject.squarespace.com/murals-1) <br> [Street Art Avenue](https://street-art-avenue.com/2014/10/ron-english-richmond-mural-project-2014-16703) <br> [Flickr – Sky Noir](https://www.flickr.com/photos/skynoir/14315097410) <br> [RVA Mag – Ron English in Richmond](https://rvamag.com/art/street-art/more-crazy-stories-from-street-art-godfather-ron-english.html) |
| 2015 | April 2015 | Houston & Bowery Wall, New York, NY, US | American Depopulation (Bowery Wall) | English’s takeover of the landmark Bowery/Houston wall fused his baby Hulk figure with an oversized U.S. flag backdrop—an image described in press coverage as a pointed critique of American excess and consumer culture. The mural became one of the site’s most photographed works of 2015, with street-art publications noting how the scale amplified the confrontational stance of English’s POPaganda universe. **[Images ↓](#bowery-wall-2015)** | [Graffiti Art Magazine](https://www.facebook.com/graffitiartmagazine/posts/10155446922310414/) <br> [EV Grieve](https://evgrieve.com/2015/09/the-houstonbowery-mural-wall-is-now.html) <br> [Untapped Cities](https://www.untappedcities.com/ron-english-criticizes-american-consumerism-with-street-art-at-bowery-mural/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2015/04/29/ron-english-and-the-american-temper-tot-pop-out-in-new-york-city/) <br> [Hypebeast](https://hypebeast.com/2015/4/ron-englishs-new-popaganda-bowery-mural-pairs-an-american-flag-with-a-hulk-baby) <br> [StreetArtNYC](https://streetartnyc.org/blog/2015/04/18/ron-english-brings-his-vision-to-the-legendary-houston-bowery-wall/) <br> [Goldman Properties – Bowery Wall](https://goldmanproperties.com/bowery-wall/) |
| 2015 | Summer 2015 (Coney Art Walls – inaugural season) | Coney Art Walls, Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, US | Grinnin’ McB (Coney Art Walls) | Coney Island’s first Coney Art Walls season assembled a major outdoor lineup curated by Jeffrey Deitch, and English contributed one of its most photographed installations: a full-wall “Grinnin’ McB” piece blending pop-culture mascots with his trademark skeletal grin. Photo sets from Time Out, Flickr, and BSA show how the mural became a standout in a project designed to revive Coney Island’s legacy of spectacle through contemporary street art. **[Images ↓](#coney-island-2015)** | [Alamy – Grinnin’ McB](https://www.alamy.com/coney-walls-art-otto-topsy-grinnin-mc-b-rex-coney-island-seaside-brooklyn-new-york-ny-usa-image230898857.html) <br> [Flickr – Elise Feinstein](https://www.flickr.com/photos/elisefeinstein/18932924542/) <br> [PMS Blog – Coney Art Walls](https://pmsstopmotion.weebly.com/pms-blog/coney-art-walls) <br> [Time Out New York](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/blog/coney-island-bring-backs-the-popular-street-art-exhibition-coney-art-walls-060316) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2015/06/24/coney-art-walls-exceeds-expectations-30-reasons-to-go/) |
| 2015 | August 5–9, 2015 (LoMan Arts Festival) | Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, New York, US | Temper Tot (pink LoMan version) | For the first LoMan Arts Festival, English returned to Mulberry Street and reimagined his signature character as a vivid pink Temper Tot towering over the block. The update transformed a well-known POPaganda landmark into a new festival centerpiece, and coverage from StreetArtNews, Viewing NYC, and Brooklyn Street Art emphasized how the refreshed mural helped establish LoMan as Lower Manhattan’s inaugural large-scale mural festival. **[Images ↓](#temper-tot-little-italy-2015)** | [StreetArtNews – New Temper Tot (2015)](https://streetartnews.net/2015/07/ron-english-temper-tot-new-piece-in.html) <br> [Viewing NYC – Pink Temper Tot](https://viewing.nyc/street-artist-ron-english-puts-up-a-new-temper-tot-in-little-italy/) <br> [Dreamstime – Pink Temper Tot Editorial](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-new-giant-pink-temper-tot-mural-ron-english-little-italy-manhattan-york-august-image57808983) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – LoMan Festival](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2015/08/12/lomanart-festival-launches-its-first-blast-in-nyc/) <br> [NY1 Spectrum – LoMan Mural Festival](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/08/5/mural-art-festival-hopes-to-leave-big-mark-on-lower-manhattan) <br> [UrbanArtNow – Purple/Pink Hulk Baby](https://www.tumblr.com/urbanartnow/125840866228/the-purple-hulk-baby-mural-by-ron-english) |
| 2015 | September 2015 | New York, New York, US | #NotACrime — “Three Wise Monkeys” mural | English contributed to the global **#EducationIsNotACrime** human-rights campaign with a mural riffing on the “three wise monkeys” theme. Installed during the United Nations General Assembly, the work formed part of a coordinated citywide push highlighting education persecution in Iran. The project placed his POPaganda style within an activist framework, joining over 40 international artists who turned Harlem and Lower Manhattan into an open-air call for justice. **[Images ↓](#notacrime-2015)** | [NotACrime – Harlem](https://www.notacrime.me/harlem) <br> [GlobeNewswire – Campaign Launch](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/09/22/1254813/0/en/NotACrime-Unveils-Street-Art-Campaign-to-Expose-Human-Rights-Abuses-in-Iran-During-United-Nations-General-Assembly.html) <br> [NotACrime – Murals](https://www.notacrime.me/harlem/murals) <br> [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/9lYcqmtENO/) |
| 2017 | March 2017 | Troutman Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York, US | Trumpty Dumpty | Painted on a Bushwick wall during the early months of the Trump presidency, *Trumpty Dumpty* quickly became one of English’s most circulated political murals. The piece reimagines Humpty Dumpty as a caricatured Trump figure perched on a cracked wall—a satirical visual that drew global attention and appeared in street-art roundups from New York to Australia. Photo archives from March 2017 confirm its placement along Troutman Street, a corridor known for large-scale political murals. **[Images ↓](#trumpty-dumpty-2017)** | [Dreamstime – Bushwick Trumpty Dumpty](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-mural-art-depicting-donald-trump-troutman-street-brooklyn-new-york-march-outdoor-gallery-known-as-bushwick-image89349508) <br> [Jacqueline Mahadel – Bushwick Street Art](https://jacquelinemhadel.com/2017/03/22/brooklyn-new-york-street-art-trumpty-dumpty-by-ron-english/) <br> [Google Street Art – Twitter archive](https://x.com/googlestreetart/status/822489895096713217) <br> [Canberra Times – Trump Art Article](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6047759/gang-gang-street-art-humpty-trumpty-has-a-great-fall/) <br> [Arrested Motion – Streets World Roundup](https://arrestedmotion.com/2016/07/streets-world-roundup-feb-21-july-10/) <br> [I Support Street Art – Trump Walls](https://www.isupportstreetart.com/trump-street-art-walls-say/) <br> [Barbara Picci – Bushwick Coverage](https://barbarapicci.com/2016/06/30/ron-english-bushwick-brooklyn/) |
| 2017 | June 8–18, 2017 | Boulevard Saint-Laurent (MURAL Festival), Montreal, Quebec, Canada | Sourire Mona Lisa | English headlined Montréal’s 2017 MURAL Festival with an outdoor wall featuring his “Sourire Mona Lisa,” a POPaganda remix blending classical portraiture with his signature surreal twists. Installed along the festival’s main corridor on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, the piece became one of the edition’s most photographed works and appeared across Canadian arts coverage and international street-art roundups. **[Images ↓](#mural-festival-2017-montreal)** | [MURAL Festival – Official Archive](https://muralfestival.com/artwork/ron-english-2017-2/) <br> [Cultura Inquieta – Festival Highlights](https://culturainquieta.com/arte/arte-urbano/el-mural-festival-de-montreal-ha-vuelto-a-dejarnos-impresionantes-obras-de-arte-urbano/) <br> [Journal Metro Montréal – Festival Program](https://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/1140830/le-festival-mural-devoile-sa-programmation/) <br> [StreetArt360 – Festival Recap](https://streetart360.net/2017/06/19/montreal-mural-festival-street-art/) |

English’s contribution stood out among the launch lineup, echoing the museum’s mission to treat Berlin’s façades as an open gallery and marking his role in a global roster assembled for the institution’s debut. **[Images ↓](#one-wall-2017)** | [Urban Nation – ONE WALL Announcement](https://urban-nation.com/2017/09/one-wall-von-ron-english/) <br> [Urban Nation – Artist Profile](https://urban-nation.com/artist/ron-english/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – Urban Nation Opening](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2017/09/page/2/) |

| 2022 | November 2022 | Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas, US | Texas Tantrum Trots and Pals | Installed in the heart of Deep Ellum’s arts district, *Texas Tantrum Trots and Pals* marked English’s return to Texas with one of the neighborhood’s most flamboyant recent murals. The piece blends POPaganda characters with Texas-themed surrealism, adding to Deep Ellum’s tradition of loud, maximalist walls. Coverage from D Magazine and StreetArtCities highlights how the mural immediately became a landmark within the district’s revitalized public-art scene. **[Images ↓](#texas-tantrum-trots-and-pals)** | [Reddit – Deep Ellum Mural](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATBGE/comments/12ol6oi/this_mural_to_keep_the_arts_district_weird/) <br> [Dreamstime – Texas Tantrum Trots and Pals](https://www.dreamstime.com/mural-titled-texas-tantrum-trots-pals-ron-english-deep-ellum-east-dallas-texas-pictured-mural-titled-texas-image262664464) <br> [D Magazine – Ron English Returns to Dallas](https://www.dmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2022/11/legendary-graffiti-artist-ron-english-comes-home-to-deep-ellum-with-a-new-mural/) <br> [StreetArtCities – Mural Marker](https://streetartcities.com/markers/4f8a47dd-06de-47c4-9fb2-e40d9149f5fa) <br> [CultureMap Dallas – Deep Ellum Art](https://dallas.culturemap.com/news/arts/deep-ellum-mural-ron-english/) |
