| 1989 | Early November 1989 (week before the fall of the Wall) | Berlin Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, West Berlin, West Germany | Checkpoint Charlie mural (“Peace on Earth”) | Painting on the western side of the Berlin Wall days before its collapse, English worked so close to the border that East German guards tried to grab him while nearby refugees shouted warnings. The week-long, unauthorized “Peace on Earth” mural became one of the most documented pieces at Checkpoint Charlie; surviving photographs, film footage, and a postcard dated 12 November 1989 continue to anchor its place in early activist street-art history. **[Images ↓](#berlin-wall-1989)** | [ILoveGraffiti](https://ilovegraffiti.de/blog/2009/11/10/ron-english-am-checkpoint-charlie-1989/) <br> [The Rumpus](https://therumpus.net/2009/11/09/ron-english-remembers-the-berlin-wall-1989/) <br> [Pond5](https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/item/10920270-west-berlin-west-germany-1988-berlin-wall-graffiti-art-bulld?dd_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) <br> [Stiftung Berliner Mauer](https://sammlung.stiftung-berliner-mauer.de/Result?sId=605&pId=13670919&sw=Postkarte&page=1&list=0&k=WEB_0405&sort=DatumAsc&smode=And&collectionTitel=Themen&collectionSubTitel=Mauerkunst&pageSize=16) <br> [Poiein Kai Prattein](http://poieinkaiprattein.org/beyond-images/photography/kuzdas/exhibition-at-goethe-in-athens/index.htm) <br> [Festival of Lights Magazine](https://magazin-festival-of-lights.de/en/berliner-mauer-kunst) |
| 2008 | December 2008 (Art Basel Miami week) | Wynwood streets (Primary Flight), Miami, Florida, US | Primary Flight mural | The second edition of Primary Flight turned Wynwood’s warehouses into a mapped open-air exhibition during Art Basel Miami Beach, and English’s wall quickly joined the neighborhood’s formative wave of large-scale murals. Curators BooksIIII, Lynn Yohana Howard, Logan Hicks, and Anthony Spinello shaped the project into an early blueprint for Wynwood’s international street-art identity. **[Images ↓](#primary-flight-2008)** | [Cool Hunting](https://coolhunting.com/culture/2008-art-basel/) <br> [Marc Woehr](https://marcwoehr.com/project/art-basel-miami-2008-wynwood-art-district/) <br> [Art Crimes – 2008 archive](https://ftp.icm.edu.pl/packages/graffiti.old/index/history2008.html) <br> [Arrested Motion](https://arrestedmotion.com/2009/12/basel-week-miami-09-ron-english-primary-flight-mural/) <br> [Designboom (general Primary Flight coverage)](https://www.designboom.com/art/primary-flight-at-art-basel-miami-12-05-08/) <br> [Junta de Andalucía – Primary Flight resource](https://edea.juntadeandalucia.es/bancorecursos/items/a3d927ad-142d-40f6-9fe5-a18c40806da8/1/viewscorm.jsp?.vi=file) |
| 2009 | December 2009 | Medicine Agency, San Francisco, California, US | Medicine Agency “Guernica” mural | In a burst of rapid brush-strokes and bold color, Ron English re-imagined Guernica inside Medicine Agency for the release of his “Mandala Grin” puzzle by ToTT Global. The resulting wall delivered a punch of street-art energy within a gallery space — part homage, part subversion — reflecting how English lays classical imagery over his trademark POPaganda lens. Fans called it a striking example of how fine-art themes and street-art bravado can collide under one roof. **[Images ↓](#medicine-agency-2009)** | [Arrested Motion – video of mural](https://arrestedmotion.com/2009/12/video-ron-english-mural-medicine-agency-gallery/) <br> [Laughing Squid – Mandala Grin release](https://laughingsquid.com/ron-english-mandala-grin-jigsaw-puzzle-release-party-signing-at-medicine-agency/) |
| 2010 | 2010 (Los Angeles Freewalls era) | Los Angeles Arts District, Los Angeles, California, US | Urban Bigfoot (LA Freewalls) | One of the most recognizable works from the early **LA Freewalls** initiative, English’s towering “Urban Bigfoot” fused his POPaganda surrealism with West Coast street-art energy. Installed in the rapidly growing Arts District, the mural became a magnet for photographers and was repeatedly featured in media discussions about LA’s changing relationship to public art. Coverage from LA Taco, Clutter Magazine, and PBS SoCal highlights how the piece helped cement Freewalls as a pivotal moment in the city’s transition from industrial zone to street-art destination. **[Images ↓](#urban-bigfoot-la)** | [Flickr – keysflyingatme](https://www.flickr.com/photos/keysflyingatme/with/5293488135) <br> [PBS SoCal – Mural Politics](https://www.pbssocal.org/history-society/mural-citations-are-off-the-wall-politics) <br> [HuffPost – Street Art](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/street-art-its-not-meant_b_5610496) <br> [LA Taco](https://lataco.com/urban-bigfoot-ron-english-la-freewalls) <br> [Clutter Magazine – Progress Update](https://www.cluttermagazine.com/news/2013/11/progress-ron-englishs-urban-bigfoot-mural-la) <br> [Clutter – Urban Bigfoot tag](https://www.cluttermagazine.com/tags/urban-bigfoot) <br> [Daily Record – Best Pictures](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/gallery/todays-best-pictures-around-globe-3767077) <br> [YouTube – Mural video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA2RbTO0MdM) |
| 2010 | November 29 – December 5, 2010 | Wynwood (Primary Flight × Contra Projects), Miami, Florida, US | Contra Projects collaborative mural | Created for the 2010 Primary Flight program in partnership with Contra Projects, this large-scale collaboration brought together Ron English, Mr. Jago, Bask, Tes One, Tristan Eaton, and others during Art Basel Miami week. English’s grinning yellow Smiley icon anchors the wall, while the surrounding psychedelic stream reflects the styles of the contributing Contra artists. Documented across Primary Flight listings and Contra Projects coverage, the mural captured the experimental, cross-pollinated energy that characterized Wynwood’s early street-art boom. **[Images ↓](#primary-flight-2010)** | [Soul of Miami – Primary Flight 2010](https://www.soulofmiami.org/2010/11/08/primary-flight-street-art-murals-1129-12510/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – Contra Projects](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/tag/contraprojects/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – Primary Flight archive](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/category/primary-flight/) <br> [Hypebeast – TrustoLand / Contra Projects](https://hypebeast.com/2010/11/ron-english-status-factory-exhibition-mural-frank-doyle-arts-pavilion) <br> [Vandalog – Fairey & Ron English in Miami](https://blog.vandalog.com/2010/11/12/fairey-ron-english-in-miami/) |
| 2010 | November–December 2010 (Art Basel Miami week) | Wynwood Walls, Miami, Florida, US | Baby Hulk / Temper Tot (Wynwood Walls) | Installed during Wynwood Walls’ 2010 Art Basel expansion, this mural introduced one of English’s most recognized POPaganda figures: a hyper-muscled “Baby Hulk” glowing against a camouflage field, flanked by a camo deer and several Delusionville characters. Coverage from Wynwood Walls and early Miami Basel reporting emphasized how the piece helped define the emerging identity of the Walls during their formative years. **[Images ↓](#wynwood-babyhulk-2010)** | [Wynwood Walls – Ron English](https://thewynwoodwalls.com/artists/ron-english/) <br> [Miami New Times – Wynwood Walls Expands](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/wynwood-walls-expands-with-ron-english-and-dearraindrop-6380212) <br> [Street Art Avenue – Baby Hulk Wynwood](https://street-art-avenue.com/2014/06/ron-english-baby-hulk-wynwood-walls-miami-8345) <br> [Beyond Square Footage](https://beyondsquarefootage.com/beyondsquarefootage/2018/5/28/ron-english-standing-strong-inside-the-walls) <br> [Miami Niche – Ron English in Wynwood](http://www.miaminiche.com/ron-english-and-that-renaissance-landmark-work-that-you-do-not-expect/) |
| 2012 | June 2012 | London Pleasure Gardens (Royal Victoria Docks), London, UK | London Pleasure Gardens murals & installations | Commissioned for the launch of the London Pleasure Gardens cultural site, English contributed multiple large-scale works across the 20-acre park. His pieces included a repurposed jumbo-jet nose cone transformed into a surreal Popaganda creature and a series of hoarding-length character panels with speech-bubble reflections that blended satire and mythology. These installations appeared alongside major works by Shepard Fairey, TrustoCorp, RISK, and others, forming one of London’s most ambitious street-art activations of the Olympic year. **[Images ↓](#lpg-2012)** | [Artlyst](https://www.artlyst.com/news/shepard-fairey-and-ron-english-tag-london-pleasure-garden/) <br> [Butterfly Art News – Preview](https://butterflyartnews.com/2012/06/30/preview-london-pleasure-gardens/) <br> [Butterfly Art News – Festival](https://butterflyartnews.com/festivals/london-pleasure-garden/) <br> [Vandalog – Street Art at LPG](https://blog.vandalog.com/2012/07/01/street-art-at-the-london-pleasure-gardens/) <br> [Clutter Magazine](https://www.cluttermagazine.com/news/2012/07/ron-english-shepard-fairey-and-trustocorp-x-london-pleasure-gardens) <br> [Vandalog – Ron English](https://blog.vandalog.com/2012/07/04/ron-english-in-40-words-or-less/) <br> [The Guardian – Fairey & English at LPG](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jun/28/shepard-fairey-largest-uk-mural) |
| 2012 | September 2012 | Stavanger (Atlantic Hotel façade), Norway | Nuart Festival mural | As one of the headlining artists of Nuart 2012, English transformed the side of the Atlantic Hotel into a towering tableau of his grinning rabbit figures. The work became one of the most photographed murals of that year’s festival, anchoring Stavanger’s reputation as Europe’s outdoor street-art capital. Coverage in Norwegian press and international street-art media highlights how the mural’s scale and placement turned it into a defining image of the 2012 edition. **[Images ↓](#nuart-2012)** | [Aftenbladet – Rabbits Invade Atlantic Hotel](https://www.aftenbladet.no/kultur/i/djRvO/kaniner-invaderer-atlantic) <br> [Getty Images – Nuart 2012 Mural](https://www.gettyimages.com.mx/detail/fotograf%C3%ADa-de-noticias/mural-by-us-street-artist-ron-english-on-the-fotograf%C3%ADa-de-noticias/848758746) <br> [Aftenbladet – 10 Nuart Works](https://www.aftenbladet.no/aktuelt/i/AdkmXE/10-fantastiske-nuart-kunstverk-vi-nesten-hadde-glemt) <br> [Vandalog – Nuart Outdoor Work](https://blog.vandalog.com/2012/10/22/nuart-part-4-more-outdoor-work/) <br> [StreetArtNews Japan – Nuart 2012](http://www.streetartnewsjapan.com/2012/09/ron-english-in.html) <br> [MarianneRa – Nuart 2012 Photo Post](https://mariannera.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/) |
| 2012 | November 2012 (New York Comedy Festival) | Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, New York, US | Temper Tot (green version) | Installed during Vandalog’s *Art of Comedy* program, the original green Temper Tot marked one of the earliest POPaganda anchors in the L.I.S.A. Project’s effort to revive Little Italy through curated murals. The piece stood out immediately—an oversized, brooding baby Hulk towering above Mulberry Street—setting the stage for later expansions of the block into a formal street-art corridor. **[Images ↓](#temper-tot-little-italy-2012)** | [Vandalog – Temper Tot (2012)](https://blog.vandalog.com/2012/11/05/ron-englishs-temper-tot-in-little-italy/) <br> [Flickr – Temper Tot 2012](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/8321047215) <br> [Thom Bradley – Little Italy Murals](https://thombradley.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/nyc-little-italy-murals/) |
| 2013 | October 2013 | Via dei Pisoni 89, Quadraro, Rome, Italy | Temper Tot & Mousemask Murphy (Quadraro) | Painted for Rome’s open-air M.U.Ro (Museo di Urban Art di Roma) project, this large wall pairs English’s baby Hulk figure Temper Tot with a gas-masked Mickey-type character. Italian press framed the mural as a portrait of a powerful nation with immature leadership, while local guides note how the flat pastel backdrop pushes the two figures forward in almost 3D relief. The wall went on to feature in Sky Arte’s *Muro a Roma* documentary and is now one of Quadraro’s best-known street-art landmarks. **[Images ↓](#mousemask-temper-rome-2013)** | [Repubblica Roma – Ron English al Quadraro](https://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/10/10/news/le_pareti_del_quadraro_per_il_warhol_della_street_art-68269324/) <br> [Repubblica Roma – Galleria fotografica](https://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/10/10/foto/la_street_art_di_ron_english_sulle_pareti_del_quadraro-68267075/) <br> [Ecomuseo Casilino – Ron English, “Senza titolo”](https://www.ecomuseocasilino.it/loc/quadraro-vecchio/page/2/) <br> [M.U.Ro – Press clippings](https://muromuseum.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_12.html) <br> [BLocal Travel – M.U.Ro walking tour](https://www.blocal-travel.com/street-art/the-muro-walking-tour-and-so-im-back-html/) <br> [Minorsights – M.U.Ro Museum of Urban Art](https://www.minorsights.com/2015/01/italy-muro-museum-of-urban-art-in-rome.html) <br> [StreetArtNYC – Rome’s Quadraro neighborhood](https://streetartnyc.org/blog/2015/09/30/street-art-nyc-in-romes-quadrado-neighborhood-with-beau-stanton-dilka-bear-maupal-ron-english-veks-van-hillik-and-mr-thoms/) |
| 2014 | October–December 2014 | Miami Marine Stadium | *Art \| History Marine Stadium Mural Project* | Site-specific murals created directly on the concrete structure of the abandoned Miami Marine Stadium as part of the Art \| History Mural Project. Ron English joined an invited roster of prominent street artists—including Crash, Tristan Eaton, Logan Hicks, The London Police, Reinier Gamboa and Jose Mertz—in producing large-scale works across the stadium’s interior and exterior surfaces. The project aimed to raise awareness for the stadium’s preservation; the murals were later photographed and issued as limited-edition prints to support restoration efforts, with related works shown during Miami Art Week. | https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2014/10/09/a-miami-waterfront-stadium-slaughtered-by-street-artists-to-save-it/ · https://streetartunitedstates.com/miami-marine-stadium/ · https://archive.constantcontact.com/fs155/1102788388105/archive/1118353439526.html · https://vimeo.com/109771373 · https://luvjonez.bandcamp.com/album/art-history-mural-project-soundtrack · https://www.instagram.com/p/s31XG_xCrH/ |
| 2014 | June 2014 (Richmond Mural Project 2014) | 646 N 7th St (wall 2), Richmond, Virginia, US | Grin Baby (Richmond Mural Project) | The 2014 Richmond Mural Project handed English a huge façade at 646 N 7th Street, where he painted an outsized “Grin Baby” head with his trademark skull-toothed smile towering over the street. The official mural map and Street Art Avenue photo set frame it as one of the festival’s landmark pieces, while local photography and RVA Mag coverage show how the wall became a recognizable #richmondmuralproject stop and an early large-scale East Coast showcase for his Grin Baby character. **[Images ↓](#grin-baby-richmond-2014)** | [Richmond Mural Project – Murals](https://richmondmuralproject.squarespace.com/murals-1) <br> [Street Art Avenue](https://street-art-avenue.com/2014/10/ron-english-richmond-mural-project-2014-16703) <br> [Flickr – Sky Noir](https://www.flickr.com/photos/skynoir/14315097410) <br> [RVA Mag – Ron English in Richmond](https://rvamag.com/art/street-art/more-crazy-stories-from-street-art-godfather-ron-english.html) |
| 2015 | March 11–15, 2015 (RXSM Self-Medicated Film Expo week) | Spider House Cafe & Ballroom, Austin, Texas, US | RXSM / Spider House Ballroom mural (with RISK) | During the 6th annual RXSM Self-Medicated Film Expo, the Spider House Ballroom’s big exterior wall was reworked into a massive collaboration between Ron English and Kelly “RISK” Gravall, painted in the thick of SXSW. Popaganda and Montana-Cans describe how the new piece replaced an older movie-themed mural with a saturated POPaganda scene that looms over the parking lot, while local coverage captures the controversy it stirred with its scantily clad cow character and skull-smiley imagery—making it one of English’s most talked-about Austin works. **[Images ↓](#rxsm-spiderhouse-2015)** | [Montana-Cans](https://www.montana-cans.blog/risk-ron-englishs-latest-mural-austin-texas/) <br> [Popaganda – RXSM: The Expression of Ron English](https://www.popaganda.com/news/archive-rxsm-the-expression-of-ron-english) <br> [Popaganda – RXSM Film Festival at Spider House Ballroom](https://www.popaganda.com/news/archive-rxsm-film-festival-at-spider-house-ballroom) <br> [The Daily Texan – Spiderhouse mural concerns reader](https://thedailytexan.com/2015/04/23/spiderhouse-mural-concerns-reader/) <br> [Instagram reel (RXSM mural)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPumpUsERNx/) |
| 2015 | April 2015 | Houston & Bowery Wall, New York, NY, US | American Depopulation (Bowery Wall) | English’s takeover of the landmark Bowery/Houston wall fused his baby Hulk figure with an oversized U.S. flag backdrop—an image described in press coverage as a pointed critique of American excess and consumer culture. The mural became one of the site’s most photographed works of 2015, with street-art publications noting how the scale amplified the confrontational stance of English’s POPaganda universe. **[Images ↓](#bowery-wall-2015)** | [Graffiti Art Magazine](https://www.facebook.com/graffitiartmagazine/posts/10155446922310414/) <br> [EV Grieve](https://evgrieve.com/2015/09/the-houstonbowery-mural-wall-is-now.html) <br> [Untapped Cities](https://www.untappedcities.com/ron-english-criticizes-american-consumerism-with-street-art-at-bowery-mural/) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2015/04/29/ron-english-and-the-american-temper-tot-pop-out-in-new-york-city/) <br> [Hypebeast](https://hypebeast.com/2015/4/ron-englishs-new-popaganda-bowery-mural-pairs-an-american-flag-with-a-hulk-baby) <br> [StreetArtNYC](https://streetartnyc.org/blog/2015/04/18/ron-english-brings-his-vision-to-the-legendary-houston-bowery-wall/) <br> [Goldman Properties – Bowery Wall](https://goldmanproperties.com/bowery-wall/) |
| 2015 | Summer 2015 (Coney Art Walls – inaugural season) | Coney Art Walls, Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, US | Grinnin’ McB (Coney Art Walls) | Coney Island’s first Coney Art Walls season assembled a major outdoor lineup curated by Jeffrey Deitch, and English contributed one of its most photographed installations: a full-wall “Grinnin’ McB” piece blending pop-culture mascots with his trademark skeletal grin. Photo sets from Time Out, Flickr, and BSA show how the mural became a standout in a project designed to revive Coney Island’s legacy of spectacle through contemporary street art. **[Images ↓](#coney-island-2015)** | [Alamy – Grinnin’ McB](https://www.alamy.com/coney-walls-art-otto-topsy-grinnin-mc-b-rex-coney-island-seaside-brooklyn-new-york-ny-usa-image230898857.html) <br> [Flickr – Elise Feinstein](https://www.flickr.com/photos/elisefeinstein/18932924542/) <br> [PMS Blog – Coney Art Walls](https://pmsstopmotion.weebly.com/pms-blog/coney-art-walls) <br> [Time Out New York](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/blog/coney-island-bring-backs-the-popular-street-art-exhibition-coney-art-walls-060316) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2015/06/24/coney-art-walls-exceeds-expectations-30-reasons-to-go/) |
| 2015 | August 5–9, 2015 (LoMan Arts Festival) | Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, New York, US | Temper Tot (pink LoMan version) | For the first LoMan Arts Festival, English returned to Mulberry Street and reimagined his signature character as a vivid pink Temper Tot towering over the block. The update transformed a well-known POPaganda landmark into a new festival centerpiece, and coverage from StreetArtNews, Viewing NYC, and Brooklyn Street Art emphasized how the refreshed mural helped establish LoMan as Lower Manhattan’s inaugural large-scale mural festival. **[Images ↓](#temper-tot-little-italy-2015)** | [StreetArtNews – New Temper Tot (2015)](https://streetartnews.net/2015/07/ron-english-temper-tot-new-piece-in.html) <br> [Viewing NYC – Pink Temper Tot](https://viewing.nyc/street-artist-ron-english-puts-up-a-new-temper-tot-in-little-italy/) <br> [Dreamstime – Pink Temper Tot Editorial](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-new-giant-pink-temper-tot-mural-ron-english-little-italy-manhattan-york-august-image57808983) <br> [Brooklyn Street Art – LoMan Festival](https://www.brooklynstreetart.com/2015/08/12/lomanart-festival-launches-its-first-blast-in-nyc/) <br> [NY1 Spectrum – LoMan Mural Festival](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/08/5/mural-art-festival-hopes-to-leave-big-mark-on-lower-manhattan) <br> [UrbanArtNow – Purple/Pink Hulk Baby](https://www.tumblr.com/urbanartnow/125840866228/the-purple-hulk-baby-mural-by-ron-english) |
| 2015 | September 2015 | New York, New York, US | #NotACrime — “Three Wise Monkeys” mural | English contributed to the global **#EducationIsNotACrime** human-rights campaign with a mural riffing on the “three wise monkeys” theme. Installed during the United Nations General Assembly, the work formed part of a coordinated citywide push highlighting education persecution in Iran. The project placed his POPaganda style within an activist framework, joining over 40 international artists who turned Harlem and Lower Manhattan into an open-air call for justice. **[Images ↓](#notacrime-2015)** | [NotACrime – Harlem](https://www.notacrime.me/harlem) <br> [GlobeNewswire – Campaign Launch](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/09/22/1254813/0/en/NotACrime-Unveils-Street-Art-Campaign-to-Expose-Human-Rights-Abuses-in-Iran-During-United-Nations-General-Assembly.html) <br> [NotACrime – Murals](https://www.notacrime.me/harlem/murals) <br> [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/9lYcqmtENO/) |
| 2017 | March 2017 | Troutman Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York, US | Trumpty Dumpty | Painted on a Bushwick wall during the early months of the Trump presidency, *Trumpty Dumpty* quickly became one of English’s most circulated political murals. The piece reimagines Humpty Dumpty as a caricatured Trump figure perched on a cracked wall—a satirical visual that drew global attention and appeared in street-art roundups from New York to Australia. Photo archives from March 2017 confirm its placement along Troutman Street, a corridor known for large-scale political murals. **[Images ↓](#trumpty-dumpty-2017)** | [Dreamstime – Bushwick Trumpty Dumpty](https://www.dreamstime.com/editorial-stock-photo-mural-art-depicting-donald-trump-troutman-street-brooklyn-new-york-march-outdoor-gallery-known-as-bushwick-image89349508) <br> [Jacqueline Mahadel – Bushwick Street Art](https://jacquelinemhadel.com/2017/03/22/brooklyn-new-york-street-art-trumpty-dumpty-by-ron-english/) <br> [Google Street Art – Twitter archive](https://x.com/googlestreetart/status/822489895096713217) <br> [Canberra Times – Trump Art Article](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6047759/gang-gang-street-art-humpty-trumpty-has-a-great-fall/) <br> [Arrested Motion – Streets World Roundup](https://arrestedmotion.com/2016/07/streets-world-roundup-feb-21-july-10/) <br> [I Support Street Art – Trump Walls](https://www.isupportstreetart.com/trump-street-art-walls-say/) <br> [Barbara Picci – Bushwick Coverage](https://barbarapicci.com/2016/06/30/ron-english-bushwick-brooklyn/) |
| 2017 | June 8–18, 2017 | Boulevard Saint-Laurent (MURAL Festival), Montreal, Quebec, Canada | Sourire Mona Lisa | English headlined Montréal’s 2017 MURAL Festival with an outdoor wall featuring his “Sourire Mona Lisa,” a POPaganda remix blending classical portraiture with his signature surreal twists.
