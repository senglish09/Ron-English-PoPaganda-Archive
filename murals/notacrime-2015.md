# 2015 – #NotACrime “Three Wise Monkeys”  
**New York City — Human Rights Campaign**

**Year:** 2015  
**Location:** New York, New York, US  

Created for the global **#EducationIsNotACrime** human-rights campaign, Ron English’s “Three Wise Monkeys” mural reinterpreted the classic motif through the lens of POPaganda and political satire. Installed during the **United Nations General Assembly**, the mural became part of a coordinated, city-wide push that turned sections of Harlem and Lower Manhattan into an open-air advocacy project calling attention to education persecution in Iran.

More than 40 international artists contributed to the initiative, and English’s mural stood out for its blend of pop-culture vocabulary, critique, and bold graphic staging—placing his visual language directly within an activist framework.
