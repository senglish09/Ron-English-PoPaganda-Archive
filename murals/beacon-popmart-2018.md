This mural was painted for Ron English’s **Beacon POP MART** pop-up shop, which opened in late June 2018. The wall features a neon, oversized Montana Mouse character spraying paint directly toward the viewer — a playful nod to English’s long-running pop-surrealist universe and his Delusionville cast.
