# 2012 – Temper Tot (Green), Little Italy  
**Mulberry Street, Manhattan, New York, US**

**Year:** 2012  
**Location:** Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, NYC  

Installed during the New York Comedy Festival as part of Vandalog’s **Art of Comedy** program, this green **Temper Tot** quickly became one of the signature early anchors of the L.I.S.A. Project’s curated mural initiative. Towering over Mulberry Street, the brooding baby Hulk introduced Ron English’s POPaganda vocabulary into the heart of Little Italy. Early coverage emphasized how this work helped catalyze the neighborhood’s transformation into a recognized street-art corridor.
