# 1988 – Fashion Moda façade mural (South Bronx)

**Year:** 1988  
**Location:** Fashion Moda, South Bronx, New York, US  

![Ron English – Fashion Moda façade mural, 1988](../images/Murals/Fashion-Moda.jpg)

## Description

For his 1988 exhibition at **Fashion Moda**, Ron English painted the art space’s entire street-facing façade with a sequence of heart forms and hybrid figures, covering the storefront with temporary panels. According to English’s later recollections, the installation survived only about a week before the whole painted façade was removed overnight, turning the piece into a short-lived episode in Fashion Moda’s history of experimental, street-visible projects.
