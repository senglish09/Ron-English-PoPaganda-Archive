# 2015 – Temper Tot (Pink), Little Italy  
**LoMan Arts Festival — Manhattan, New York, US**

**Year:** 2015  
**Location:** Little Italy (Mulberry St.), Manhattan, NYC  

Painted for the first **LoMan Arts Festival**, Ron English returned to Mulberry Street and reimagined Temper Tot in a vivid **pink** variant towering above the neighborhood. The refreshed mural transformed a familiar POPaganda landmark into a new festival centerpiece. Coverage from StreetArtNews, Viewing NYC, and Brooklyn Street Art highlighted how this piece helped solidify LoMan as Lower Manhattan’s inaugural large-scale mural festival, drawing heavy foot traffic and becoming one of the event’s most shared installations.
