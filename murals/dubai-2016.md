## Description

In March 2016, Ron English created a large-scale mural at **City Walk** as part of *Dubai Walls*, the first major outdoor street-art initiative in the Middle East.  
The mural features his signature POPaganda cast — including mutated pop characters, Delusionville animals, and hybrid cartoon-creatures — rendered across a multi-panel architectural façade.

*Dubai Walls* invited 15 internationally known street artists, including Ron English, Futura, Nick Walker, Blek le Rat, and Beau Stanton, to transform City Walk into an open-air museum of contemporary muralism.
