## Description

In March 2009 a collaborative mural by Ron English, Bigfoot and Jason Maloney was painted on the exterior of Hudson County Art Supply in downtown Jersey City, at the corner of Cole Street / First Street. The project marked a public-art initiative launched to bring large-scale street art to the city. According to contemporary reports, the work attracted attention from local authorities and passersby, reflecting a push to transform urban blight into street-art that enlivens community spaces. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
