# 2019 – *Elefanka and Mousezilla* (Erie & 16th St., Jersey City)

**Year:** 2019  
**Location:** Erie Street basketball court, 266 Erie St, Jersey City  
**Program:** Jersey City Mural Arts Program

Commissioned as part of the Jersey City Mural Arts Program, this two-wall, sixty-foot installation pairs a butterfly-winged orange **Elefanka** with a towering green **Mousezilla**, both drawn from English’s *Delusionville* universe.  
Painted overlooking a neighborhood schoolyard, the mural became one of Jersey City’s signature POPaganda landmarks. Local press and mural-map guides note how English — then a Jersey City resident — helped shape the city’s early push to turn everyday corners into open-air galleries.
