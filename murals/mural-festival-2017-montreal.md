# 2017 – *Sourire Mona Lisa*  
**MURAL Festival — Montréal, Quebec, Canada**

**Year:** 2017  
**Location:** Boulevard Saint-Laurent, Montréal  

Ron English headlined the 2017 MURAL Festival with *Sourire Mona Lisa*, a large outdoor work blending classical portraiture with POPaganda surrealism. Installed along the festival’s central artery, Boulevard Saint-Laurent, the wall became one of the most photographed pieces of the edition.  
Canadian arts outlets and international street-art coverage highlighted its bold reinterpretation of the Mona Lisa motif and its presence within one of North America’s defining urban-art festivals.
