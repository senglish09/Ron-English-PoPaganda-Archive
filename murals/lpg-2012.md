# 2012 – London Pleasure Gardens murals & installations  
**Royal Victoria Docks, London, UK**

**Year:** 2012  
**Location:** London Pleasure Gardens, London, UK  

Commissioned for the opening of the 20-acre **London Pleasure Gardens** cultural development, Ron English installed multiple large-scale works throughout the site. His contributions included:

- a repurposed jumbo-jet **nose cone** transformed into an oversized Popaganda creature, and  
- a long series of **speech-bubble hoarding panels** blending mythology, satire, and character-driven storytelling.

These installations appeared alongside landmark works by Shepard Fairey, TrustoCorp, RISK, and others, forming one of London’s most ambitious street-art activations of the 2012 Olympic year.
