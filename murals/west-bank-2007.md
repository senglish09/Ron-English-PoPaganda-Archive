## Location  
**Bethlehem area, Palestine — West Bank Separation Barrier**

## Year  
**2007**

## Title  
**“Pardon Our Oppression” (protest mural intervention)**

## Description  
In 2007, Ron English contributed a striking intervention to the West Bank separation barrier near Bethlehem. The wall served as an open-air protest site for international street artists, and English’s work stood out for its mix of painted sections and poster-like treatments. The mural combines fragmented red-and-white fields with a militarized clown figure and the stenciled phrase **“Pardon Our Oppression.”**  
The imagery reflects English’s long-running critique of propaganda, militarism, and the visual language of power.
