## Description

Ron English’s **“Punk & Pink Skunk”** mural was painted in late May 2021 at **Coney Art Walls**, adding two bold Delusionville-inspired characters to the longtime Coney Island street-art site curated by Jeffrey Deitch. The piece features a stylized orange-and-blue **“Punk Skunk”** tag at the center flanked by English’s trademark hybrid figures. The mural became one of the standout new works installed during the early 2021 season as Coney Art Walls reopened.
