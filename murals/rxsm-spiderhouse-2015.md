# 2015 – RXSM / Spider House Ballroom mural  
**Austin, Texas — collaboration with RISK**

**Year:** 2015  
**Location:** Spider House Cafe & Ballroom, Austin, Texas, US  

Painted during the **6th annual RXSM Self-Medicated Film Expo**—right in the middle of SXSW—this massive exterior wall became a high-visibility collaboration between **Ron English** and **Kelly “RISK” Graval**. The new painting replaced Spider House’s long-standing movie-themed mural with a saturated POPaganda scene: skull-smiley iconography, explosive colors, and a controversial scantily clad cow character that sparked commentary in Austin press.

Popaganda, Montana-Cans, and local blogs frame the piece as a defining moment of the festival year—an unexpected collision of film-expo energy, SXSW chaos, and two of the most recognizable aesthetics in contemporary street art. The mural has since become one of English’s most photographed works in Austin.
