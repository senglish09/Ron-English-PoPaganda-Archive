# 2022 – Plessy School Mural, New Orleans

**Year:** May 27, 2022  
**Location:** Plessy School, New Orleans, Louisiana  
**Program:** Community mural / school collaboration project

Commissioned as part of a community-engagement initiative at the historic Plessy School, this mural brought Ron English together with local students to design and paint a large public artwork.  
The piece merges English’s recognizable POPaganda vocabulary with neighborhood participation, reinforcing his long-standing interest in connecting his practice to civic spaces through collaborative creation.
