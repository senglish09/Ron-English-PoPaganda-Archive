# 2018 – Seventh-floor POPaganda walls, ProAm Studio City (Dongguan, China)

**Year:** 2018  
**Location:** ProAm Studio City building, Changping Town, Dongguan, Guangdong, China  

Ron English developed a suite of POPaganda characters on the seventh floor of the ProAm Studio City building, part of Pop Life Global’s creative hub in Dongguan. The project links his ongoing collaborations with Pop Life to the company’s in-house “ProAm Studio City” complex, where multiple artists were invited to turn entire floors into immersive environments.
