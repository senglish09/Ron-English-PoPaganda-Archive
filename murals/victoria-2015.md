## Description

During a multi-day visit to Victoria, Texas, Ron English teamed up with legendary West Coast graffiti artist **RISK** to paint two companion murals for the **VTXIFF / RxSM Film Festival** downtown art program.

The murals — a neon-colored **Brain Elephant** and a glowing **Brain Heart** — were executed across consecutive walls and became widely photographed symbols of the festival’s citywide activations. Both artists documented the process on their respective social platforms, marking one of their notable collaborative street pieces of 2015.
