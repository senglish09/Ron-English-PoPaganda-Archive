# 2021 – Jersey City Mural Festival Rooftop Mural

**Year:** June 5–6, 2021  
**Location:** Coles Street rooftop, Jersey City  
**Program:** Jersey City Mural Festival (inaugural edition)

Painted live during the inaugural **Jersey City Mural Festival**, this multi-character rooftop façade extended English’s long-running relationship with Jersey City’s public-art scene.  
Festival coverage described the weekend as a “Woodstock for artists,” noting how English’s Delusionville characters and flowing paint streams transformed the warehouse roof into a POPaganda spectacle visible across the festival zone.
