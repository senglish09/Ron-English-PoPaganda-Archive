# 2015 – *American Depopulation*  
**Bowery/Houston Wall, New York City**

**Year:** 2015  
**Location:** Bowery & Houston Wall, New York, NY  

Ron English’s takeover of the landmark **Bowery/Houston Wall**—one of the most historically significant mural locations in New York—featured his baby Hulk (Temper Tot) erupting in front of a massive stylized U.S. flag. Contemporary coverage emphasized the mural’s pointed commentary on American consumerism, excess, and political spectacle. Street-art publications noted that the wall’s monumental scale amplified the confrontational tone of the piece, making it one of the most photographed Bowery installations of 2015.
