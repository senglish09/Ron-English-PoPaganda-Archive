## Description

In 2017 Ron English returned to his hometown of Decatur to produce “Elefanka,” a mural painted on the exterior wall of Ken’s Aquarium & Pet Supply. The character — emblematic of English’s POPaganda universe — joins other community murals commissioned under the Decatur Area Arts Council’s Mural Project. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

The mural emerged as part of a larger local effort to enrich public space with art, making visible the artist’s roots and playful aesthetic in the city of his birth. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
