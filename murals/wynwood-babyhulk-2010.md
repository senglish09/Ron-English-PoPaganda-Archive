# 2010 – Baby Hulk / Temper Tot (Wynwood Walls, Miami)

**Year:** 2010  
**Location:** Wynwood Walls, Miami, Florida, US  

Installed during Wynwood Walls’ 2010 Art Basel expansion, this mural introduced one of Ron English’s most recognized POPaganda figures: a hyper-muscled **Baby Hulk / Temper Tot** glowing against a camouflage field and surrounded by Delusionville characters. Early Miami Art Week coverage and Wynwood Walls’ own archive highlight how this piece helped establish the aesthetic identity of the Walls during their formative years, becoming one of the site's most photographed works.
