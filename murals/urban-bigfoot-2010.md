# 2010 – Urban Bigfoot (Los Angeles Freewalls)

**Year:** 2010  
**Location:** Los Angeles Arts District, Los Angeles, California, US  

One of the most recognizable works from the early **LA Freewalls** initiative, “Urban Bigfoot” blended Ron English’s POPaganda surrealism with the raw energy of the emerging Arts District. The towering figure became a photographer magnet and frequently appeared in media discussions about Los Angeles’ evolving relationship to street art. Coverage from LA Taco, Clutter Magazine, and PBS SoCal underscores how the mural helped define Freewalls as a pivotal moment in the transformation of the neighborhood from industrial zone to street-art hub.
