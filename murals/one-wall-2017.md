# 2017 – *ONE WALL*  
**Urban Nation Museum — Berlin, Germany**

**Year:** 2017  
**Location:** Schöneberg, Berlin (Urban Nation / ONE WALL Program)

Created for Urban Nation’s inaugural **ONE WALL** program, this mural became part of the museum’s permanent outdoor collection during its opening season.  
English’s contribution stood out among the launch lineup, echoing the museum’s mission to treat Berlin’s façades as an open-air gallery. The piece positioned English among a global roster of artists chosen for the institution’s debut, reinforcing his long-standing presence in European street-art culture.
