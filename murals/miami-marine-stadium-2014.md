# 2014 – Miami Marine Stadium (Art | History Mural Project)  
**Miami, Florida**

**Year:** 2014  
**Location:** Miami Marine Stadium, Miami, Florida, US  

Created for the **Art & History Mural Project**, Ron English’s murals were produced directly on the aging concrete structure of the abandoned Miami Marine Stadium. English joined a roster of major street artists—including Crash, Tristan Eaton, Logan Hicks, The London Police, Reinier Gamboa, and Jose Mertz—transforming both the stadium interior and exterior into a large-scale collaborative installation.

The initiative aimed to raise awareness for the historic stadium’s preservation. Photographs of the murals were later issued as limited-edition prints to support restoration efforts, with related exhibitions shown during Miami Art Week.
