# 2008 – Primary Flight mural (Wynwood, Miami)

**Year:** 2008  
**Location:** Wynwood streets (Primary Flight), Miami, Florida, US  

Primary Flight’s second edition turned Wynwood’s warehouses into a mapped open-air exhibition during Art Basel Miami Beach.  
Ron English’s wall became part of the early wave of large-scale murals that helped define Wynwood’s street-art identity. Curators BooksIIII, Lynn Yohana Howard, Logan Hicks, and Anthony Spinello shaped the program into one of the neighborhood’s foundational mural initiatives.
