# 2014 – “Zelephant” mural (Waterfront Film Festival)

**Year:** 2014  
**Location:** South Haven, Michigan, US  

## Description

Ron English painted the **“Zelephant”** mural during the **Waterfront Film Festival** in South Haven, Michigan, in June 2014. The festival invited artists to create live outdoor works, and English contributed this hybrid zebra–elephant figure, a recurring character in his POPaganda universe. Painted in a single day, the bright red-and-yellow wall quickly became one of the most photographed pieces of the 2014 event.
