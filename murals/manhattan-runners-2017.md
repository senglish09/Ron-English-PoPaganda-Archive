# 2017 – *Manhattan Runners* (NYC Marathon Mural)

**Year:** 2017  
**Location:** 1st Avenue at St. Marks Place, Manhattan, New York  
**Event:** TCS NYC Marathon – official mural program

Painted along the route of the TCS New York City Marathon, *Manhattan Runners* turned a portion of 1st Avenue into a live urban gallery.  
The piece functioned as both street art and an interactive moment for thousands of runners and spectators who passed the wall during the marathon.  
Press coverage highlighted how the project tied contemporary muralism to one of NYC’s most iconic annual events.
