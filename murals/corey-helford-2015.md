## Description

On December 8, 2015, Ron English painted a new outdoor mural on the side of the **newly opened Corey Helford Gallery** in the Los Angeles Arts District. The piece — a striking orange **Monarch Elephant** with butterfly-wing patterning — was created as part of the gallery’s move to its large 12,000-sq-ft space at 571 S. Anderson Street.

The mural became a signature landmark for the gallery and remains one of English’s most photographed L.A. street works.
