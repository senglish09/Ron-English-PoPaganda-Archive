# 2022 – LCCC Mural / Delusionville Characters (Washington, D.C.)

## Description

In early March 2022, Ron English completed a new Delusionville-themed mural in Washington, D.C., featuring two suited Delusionville characters flanking a glowing yellow “Grin” smiley. Painted for **LCCC** (often connected with community-based cultural revitalization efforts) and the nonprofit **Murals for Humanity**, the work expanded English’s presence in the capital and was heavily circulated during the 2022 D.C. street-art season.

The mural merges English’s iconic “Grin” motif with his Delusionville universe, producing a saturated, high-energy façade consistent with his recent public-art work.
