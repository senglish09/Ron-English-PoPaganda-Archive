# 2014 – Rooftop trompe-l’œil “Pool” (Black Ocean, Chelsea)

**Year:** 2014  
**Location:** Black Ocean, Chelsea, New York, US  

![Ron English – Rooftop “Pool” trompe-l’œil, Black Ocean, Chelsea (2014)](../images/Murals/BlackOcean-Pool-2014.jpg)

A full-roof trompe-l’œil illusion painted by Ron English atop the **Black Ocean** building in Chelsea.  
The work creates the appearance of a glowing, sunlit swimming pool when viewed from surrounding windows — an atmospheric street-art–style intervention in a private commercial rooftop environment. English documented the installation on November 5, 2014, confirming the location and authorship.
