## Description

In 2013 Ron English participated in the Avant-Garde Urbano mural program in Spain, producing a large outdoor wall as part of the festival. The work reflects his signature tropes — playful distortion, vibrant colors, and social pop-surreal elements — adapted to the context of the European street-art environment. The mural was featured in festival photo coverage and subsequent street-art press.
