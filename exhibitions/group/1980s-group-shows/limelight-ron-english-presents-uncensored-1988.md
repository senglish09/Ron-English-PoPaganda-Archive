## Overview  

A one-night downtown presentation at **Limelight**, curated by Ron English, extending his interventionist and pop-subversive approaches to media culture and alternative exhibition spaces in the late 1980s.  

The show continued English’s early strategy of placing unconventional art programming within nightlife environments, a tactic closely tied to his Fashion Moda affiliations and Manhattan club-culture networks.
