## Overview  

Group show at New York’s Limelight, presented by Ron English and featuring artworks under his early pseudonym **Randall Hart**. Positioned within English’s early 1980s circle, the exhibition included collaborations and parallel works and demonstrated his transition between conceptual practice and the beginnings of his later satirical pop-language.

This rare event is significant for understanding English’s alternate identity and early curatorial roles in the New York nightlife/art crossover scene.
