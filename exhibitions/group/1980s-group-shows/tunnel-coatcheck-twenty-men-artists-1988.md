**Year:** 1988  
**Date:** September 21, 1988  
**Venue:** Tunnel (Coatcheck Gallery)  
**Location:** New York, New York, US  
**Show Title:** *Twenty Men Artists*  

---

## Overview  

A one-night exhibition featuring twenty works by twenty male artists, including **Ron English**. The title played knowingly with debates around feminist and male-centered exhibition histories of the 1980s, operating as a satirical counterpoint within the downtown scene.  

The show reflected the spontaneous, short-run format typical of Tunnel’s alternative project spaces during this period.
