Overview

Art on the Run was a group exhibition curated by Grace Harkin featuring experimental and emerging East Village artists. The show, on view until March 29, 1989, included Ron English among its contributors.¹ The review in ARTspeak highlights the exhibition’s emphasis on inventive and unconventional approaches, consistent with the gallery’s reputation for presenting some of the East Village’s most exploratory work.¹

The article specifically cites Ron English’s large painting “The Last Lunch”, describing it as a surreal juxtaposition of symbolic imagery ranging from a glowing McDonald’s sign to a quiet plate of fish.¹ The work reflects English’s developing anti-corporate iconography and his early engagement with pop-cultural religious satire, themes that would define later Popaganda works.

The ARTspeak review positions Art on the Run as one of Harkin’s notable group exhibitions, foregrounding artists whose work challenged the visual and cultural norms of late-1980s New York.¹
