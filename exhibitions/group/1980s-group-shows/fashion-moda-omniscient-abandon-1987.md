## Overview  

Presented at the experimental Bronx space **Fashion Moda**, *Omniscient Abandon* was a hybrid installation and group-participation environment featuring Ron English and collaborators. The exhibition extended English’s interest in immersive pop-culture appropriations, overlapping installation, image appropriation and conceptual performance.

An after-show party for the exhibition was held at New York club **The World**, reflecting the cross-over between art, nightlife and post-punk culture in late-1980s Manhattan.
