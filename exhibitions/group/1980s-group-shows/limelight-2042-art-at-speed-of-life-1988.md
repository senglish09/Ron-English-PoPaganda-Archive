## Overview  

A major collective exhibition at **Limelight**, produced through **Fashion Moda**, featuring more than two dozen artists from the downtown and Bronx-associated avant-garde, including **Ron English** and **Susan English** alongside **DAZE, Stefan Eins, Lee Quinones, Martin Wong**, and others.

The show reflected Fashion Moda’s hybrid programming model—moving between Bronx institutional platforms and Manhattan nightlife venues—while extending the dialogue between graffiti, post-punk installation, and socially charged art in the late 1980s.
