## Overview

*Draw the Crime – The Subversions of Ron English* brought the artist’s politically charged billboard interventions into the setting of **Soma NYC**, a counterculture store-gallery in New York. The exhibition focused on English’s long-running practice of hijacking advertising language and corporate mascots and turning them into sharp critiques of consumerism, war and media influence.

The show opened on **October 3** with a 7–11 pm reception and presented a body of work that included pieces such as **_KISS Kids on Coke_**, where rock iconography and soda branding collide in a single image. Installed inside a hybrid retail–gallery environment, the exhibition underlined how English blurs the line between street action, pop product and fine art object, placing his subversive images back into a commercial context for viewers to confront at close range.
