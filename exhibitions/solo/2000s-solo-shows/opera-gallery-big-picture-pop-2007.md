## Overview

*Big Picture Pop* presented Ron English’s large-scale canvases and sculptural works at **Opera Gallery’s SoHo location** during the 2007 holiday season. This exhibition highlighted English’s mastery of oversized pop-icon imagery — including reengineered advertising mascots, hybrid cultural figures, and high-saturation visual satire.

Press coverage from the time noted strong turnout and enthusiasm, as the show arrived at a moment when Pop Surrealism and designer-toy culture were expanding rapidly in New York. English’s work bridged fine art and pop culture, echoing his billboard interventions while delivering polished, gallery-ready compositions.

The exhibition ran through late December and aligned English with a global roster of contemporary artists represented by Opera Gallery.
