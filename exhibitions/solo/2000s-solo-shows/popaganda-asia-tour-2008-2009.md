## Overview

The *POPaganda Asia Tour* marked Ron English’s major expansion into the Asian pop-art and designer-toy market between **late 2008 and early 2009**. Launched at **Delay No Mall / MINDstyle LIFEstyle in Hong Kong**, the tour blended fine art, limited-edition collectibles, live signings and promotional drops across Asia.

### **Hong Kong Launch (Late 2008)**
The tour debuted with large crowds, media coverage and exclusive releases that positioned English as a crossover figure between street art, pop surrealism and the booming vinyl-toy world.

### **Manila (January 2009)**
At **Fresh Manila**, English presented additional works and hosted signings, with local press highlighting the appearance of pieces referencing **Abraham Obama**, cultural parody and hybrid pop-iconography.

### **Shanghai (2009)**
Further events and special releases—such as the *MC Supersized Camo* edition—connected the tour to Shanghai’s emerging urban-art market.

This multi-city tour underscored English’s international reach and cultivated a strong collector base in Asia, particularly among designer-toy and pop-culture audiences.
