## Ron English — *Modernism for a New Millennium*  
**Sam Cintron Gallery, Jersey City, New Jersey, US**<br>
**January 27 – February 27, 2000**

**Venue and dates**  
Ron English presented the exhibition **“Modernism for a New Millennium”** at **Sam Cintron Gallery**,  
**520 Jersey Avenue, Jersey City, NJ 07302**, from **January 27 to February 27, 2000**.<sup>1</sup>  
The postcard lists an opening reception on **Thursday, January 27, 6:30–9:30 p.m.**, and gallery hours  
of **Tuesday–Saturday, 10:00 a.m.–6:00 p.m.; Monday by appointment only**.<sup>1</sup>

**Exhibition description**  
According to a feature in the *Jersey Journal*, this was English’s first solo show in Jersey City and  
included **more than a dozen oil paintings** on view at Sam Cintron Gallery.<sup>2</sup> The article  
describes works that re-used and altered well-known twentieth-century images and advertising figures,  
including a painting titled **“Culture Wars,”** in which English reworked Picasso’s **“Guernica”** with  
Disney characters, and other canvases referencing pop-culture icons such as Mickey Mouse.<sup>2</sup>  
Photos in the same article show English in front of his painting **“English 101”** and reproduce a detail  
from **“Play It Again, Sam,”** both identified as on display at the gallery.<sup>2</sup>

The exhibition postcard notes **“Weeping Women”** (1996, oil on canvas, 66" × 52") as one of the works  
associated with the show.<sup>1</sup>

**Mi Gente Magazine coverage**  
A social feature in **Mi Gente Magazine** documents events connected with English’s exhibition and  
his release after a local arrest related to his public artwork.<sup>3</sup> The article refers to  
English as “un pintor realista con el sabor de ‘pop’” and records a gathering at **The Palette Art  
Gallery**, Jersey City, where council member **Mariano Vega Jr.** and others congratulated English.<sup>3</sup>  
Mi Gente notes that English’s work was exhibited there on **December 27** and that he was later freed  
by order of Councilman Vega; it also states that English is known internationally and provides a  
Jersey Avenue gallery address and phone number for those wishing to see more of his work.<sup>3</sup>  
These details give additional context for English’s activity in Jersey City at the time of  
*Modernism for a New Millennium*.
