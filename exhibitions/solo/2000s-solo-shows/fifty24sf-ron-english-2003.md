## Overview

This 2003 solo exhibition at **FIFTY24SF Gallery**, presented in partnership with Upper Playground, marked one of Ron English’s earliest San Francisco showcases. The gallery—well known for its focus on contemporary urban art—highlighted English’s evolving approach to pop-culture reinvention during this period.

The material featured in the FIFTY24SF archive points to English’s remixes of **Marilyn Monroe, the Mona Lisa and Warhol-era iconography**, each reinterpreted through his Popaganda lens. These works served as predecessors to larger series that English would continue developing with the gallery throughout the mid-2000s.
