## Overview  

Varnish Fine Art hosted **Ron English’s 2005 solo exhibition *Son of Pop***, announced through an official printed showcard that listed the run from **May 28 to July 2, 2005**, with an opening reception on **Thursday, June 2**, and a private preview on **May 28**.<sup>1</sup>  
The show foregrounded English’s investigations into American advertising, cartoon archetypes, and the cultural afterlife of pop icons. Contemporary coverage by *Laughing Squid* described the exhibition as part of English’s expanding presence in West Coast art spaces, highlighting the artist’s blend of satire and technical precision.<sup>2</sup>  
An independent graffiti-culture timeline documenting U.S. street-art history also records English’s *Son of Pop* exhibition at Varnish Fine Art under its 2005 entries.<sup>3</sup>  
A 2005 artwork listing on Invaluable further associates English’s production from this period with motifs showcased during the exhibition, including hybrid pop-culture figures rendered through his signature painterly realism.<sup>4</sup>
