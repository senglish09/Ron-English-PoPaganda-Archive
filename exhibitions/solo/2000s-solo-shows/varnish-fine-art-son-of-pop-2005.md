## Overview

*Son of Pop* was Ron English’s early-summer 2005 solo program at **Varnish Fine Art** in San Francisco’s SoMa district. Framed around English’s role as a “son” of Pop art, the exhibition focused on his reworking of **mass-media icons, advertising mascots and comic-book heroes**, filtered through his Popaganda approach.

The show gathered paintings and sculptures that pushed familiar characters into stranger territory—corporate mascots twisted into Frankensteined hybrids, pop-culture saints and sinners rendered with hyper-polished technique but steeped in satire. Preview events and opening receptions helped anchor the exhibition to Varnish’s summer schedule, drawing in both local art audiences and fans of lowbrow/Pop Surrealism.

Installed in Varnish’s industrial gallery space, *Son of Pop* underlined how English extends the Pop lineage of Warhol and Lichtenstein into a media landscape saturated with branding, while keeping a sharp focus on culture-jamming and billboard subversion.
