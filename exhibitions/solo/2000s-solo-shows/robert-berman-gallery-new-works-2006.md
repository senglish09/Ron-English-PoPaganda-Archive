## Overview

*Ron English — New Works* marked the artist’s 2006 solo presentation at **Robert Berman Gallery** within Bergamot Station’s Berman/Turner program. The exhibition featured new paintings and studio works expanding English’s evolving **POPaganda** iconography — including reimagined advertising mascots, twisted pop-culture archetypes, and hyper-saturated visual satire.

Within Berman’s contemporary program, English’s work aligned with the gallery’s interest in artists who interrogate mass media and American cultural mythology. The exhibition introduced Los Angeles audiences to several motifs that would define English’s mid-2000s output, including his polished treatment of corporate mascots, religious/historical mashups, and reality-bent Americana.
