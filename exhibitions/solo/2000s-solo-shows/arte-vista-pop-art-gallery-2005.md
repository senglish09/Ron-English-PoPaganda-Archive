## Overview

Held over Easter weekend in 2005, this two-day pop-art exhibition at **Arte Vista: The Pop-Art Gallery** introduced Ron English’s work to audiences in the Netherlands. According to the Dutch exhibition invitation, English **officially opened the show at 13:00 on Sunday, 27 March**, marking his presence as a featured international artist at the event.

The showcard highlights several of English’s recurring themes at the time, including his **absinthe-inspired imagery** and reimagined **Marilyn iconography**, both central elements of his early-2000s Popaganda output. Though brief, the exhibition positioned English within a European pop-art context and circulated printed promotional materials showing some of his best-known motifs.
