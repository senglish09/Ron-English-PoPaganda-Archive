## Overview

This 2009 exhibition at **The Don Gallery** in Milan marked Ron English’s **first solo show in Italy**. Running from **July 9 to August 25, 2009**, the exhibition presented a focused selection of new paintings and sculptures that blended political satire, pop iconography and English’s trademark Popaganda sensibility.

Coverage emphasized the way English’s work translated into the Italian contemporary-art context: mashups of cartoon mascots, corporate logos and cultural symbols appeared alongside more overtly political pieces, introducing Milanese audiences to his critique of advertising, consumerism and media imagery. The opening drew strong attendance and positioned The Don Gallery as an early Italian supporter of international Pop Surrealism and lowbrow-inspired painting.
