## Overview

*The Secret History of KISS* was Ron English’s 2008 solo exhibition at **Shooting Gallery** in San Francisco’s Larkin Street district, strategically timed to coincide with the U.S. election season. The show blended English’s high-saturation Popaganda style with political parody, celebrity critique and rock-icon reinvention.

The exhibition reimagined the rock band **KISS** through English’s lens of cultural satire—merging political motifs, branding tropes and comic exaggeration. Large-scale paintings and installation works drew strong turnout, with significant local press coverage from art blogs, culture magazines, and gallery reviewers.
