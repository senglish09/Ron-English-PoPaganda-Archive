## Overview

This 2004 solo exhibition at **Marcoart Gallery** in the Lower East Side brought Ron English’s culture-jamming ethos into one of New York’s most irreverent creative spaces. Presented by **Marcoart and Duro CIA**, the show emphasized English’s decades-long practice of billboard takeovers, pop-icon subversions and satirical interventions.

Promotional texts from the time describe English as a **“POPagandist, billboard bandit, post-pop pundit, post-punk prankster and countercultural cartoonist”**, underlining his hybrid role as both fine artist and media saboteur. His work here spanned themes of corporate critique, political commentary, cartoon logic and a playful irreverence toward cultural authority.  

The exhibition framed English as a figure operating somewhere between **Abbie Hoffman** and a “grown-up Bart Simpson,” delivering highly crafted imagery with undertones of humor, mischief and cultural resistance.
