## Overview

*Lazarus Rising* was Ron English’s first UK solo exhibition with **Elms Lesters Painting Rooms**, opening on **8 May 2009** in London. The show unveiled monumental canvases and politically charged compositions, including English’s large-scale reinterpretations of **Picasso’s _Guernica_** and related works that push his Popaganda vocabulary into historical and war-themed territory.

The exhibition framed English’s practice as a dialogue between classic modernist painting and contemporary mass-media imagery. Satirical takes on propaganda, religion, and consumer culture were rendered with dense detail and intense color, reinforcing his reputation for fusing pop iconography with biting social critique.

The show was accompanied by a **hardcover catalogue**, also titled *Lazarus Rising*, which documented the paintings and provided additional context for the series.
