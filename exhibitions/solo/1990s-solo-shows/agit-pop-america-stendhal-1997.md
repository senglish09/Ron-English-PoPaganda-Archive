## Agit-Pop America — Gallery Stendhal, New York (April 3–30, 1997)

Ron English’s exhibition **_Agit-Pop America_** took place at **Gallery Stendhal** in New York from **April 3 to April 30, 1997**. The show card announced that the exhibition presented “New Works by Ron English” and noted a cocktail reception held on **April 3 from 6–9 p.m.** at **386 West Broadway, 2nd floor, New York, NY 10012**.<sup>1</sup>

A printed review by **Tarssa Yazdani**, titled **“Agit-Pop America,”** offers detailed coverage of the exhibition. The text highlights English’s use of American visual iconography, his juxtaposition of popular imagery, and his interest in how cultural memory shapes interpretation. Yazdani describes the works as balancing confrontational imagery with ambiguity, and notes English’s recurring strategy of synthesizing shared cultural references, humor, and political nuance.<sup>2</sup>

Several artworks reproduced in the review — including **_Wings of Desire_**, **_The New World Order_**, and others — document the thematic range presented in the exhibition.<sup>2</sup>

A separate printed announcement from the period advertises an **official after-party** for the exhibition, hosted by **Reuben Rubin** and **Lee Klein** at **Opera**, 539 W. 21st Street, New York, on **April 3, 1997**, coinciding with the opening reception.<sup>3</sup>
