## Overview

Presented at the iconic **Maxwell’s** venue in Hoboken and organized by **Jonathan LeVine**, this early solo exhibition brought together paintings, drawings, photography, and giclée editions at a moment when LeVine was building what would later become his well-known gallery program.

The exhibition helped consolidate English’s presence within alternative and music-adjacent art spaces. Maxwell’s—famous for hosting underground bands—provided an environment where English’s work could intersect with subcultural audiences, amplifying the Popaganda ethos that would define his later career.
