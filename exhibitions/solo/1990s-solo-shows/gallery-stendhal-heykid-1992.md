## Exhibition Overview

Ron English presented the exhibition **“Hey! My Kid Could Do That!”** at **Gallery Stendhal**,  
622–626 Broadway, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10012.<sup>1</sup>  
The exhibition ran from **November 12 to December 12, 1992**, with an opening reception on

The event was co-sponsored by QP/Ian Alterman, and the showcard states that all art purchases  
included a donation to the Learning Through Art / Guggenheim Children’s Program.<sup>1</sup>

An article published in *SunStorm Fine Art* (Absolute Collection) in **October 1992** discusses  
English’s fall New York exhibition titled **“My Kid Could Do That”**, describing work featuring  
collaborations with family members and imagery derived from children’s drawings.<sup>2</sup>

A feature in **Spy Magazine** (January 1993) references the Gallery Stendhal exhibition  
**“Hey! My Kid Could Do That!”**, identifying it as a display of paintings and drawings created  
by preschool children and “remastered” by English.<sup>3</sup> Spy Magazine also notes that  
Gallery Stendhal provided the press kit for the show.<sup>3</sup>

Ron English’s exhibitions during this period.<sup>4</sup>
