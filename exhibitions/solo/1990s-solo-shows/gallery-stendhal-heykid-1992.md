## Overview

This exhibition marked one of Ron English’s most pointed early critiques of commercial culture and childhood iconography. *HEY! My Kid Could Do That!* blended satire, appropriation and social commentary, drawing on toy imagery, advertising tropes and the aesthetics of children’s art to question how visual culture shapes identity and desire.

Part of the show’s proceeds supported the **Guggenheim Museum’s Learning Through Art program**, reflecting English’s longstanding interest in education and creative literacy. Contemporary coverage emphasized the exhibition’s bold humor and its challenge to conventional notions of “high art.”
