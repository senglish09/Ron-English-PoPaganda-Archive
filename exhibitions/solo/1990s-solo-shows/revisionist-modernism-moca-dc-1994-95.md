## Exhibition Overview

Ron English presented **“Revisionist Modernism: New Works”** at **Clark & Co.**,  
1054 31st Street NW, Washington, D.C.<sup>1</sup> The exhibition, covered in early  
1995 press, featured English’s reinterpretations of compositions and subjects  
drawn from major figures in art history.<sup>1</sup>

According to *The Washington Post*, English created works referencing Manet,  
Motherwell, Warhol, and other canonical artists without altering the underlying  
technical complexity of the source material.<sup>1</sup> The review discusses several  
works, including:

- **“Luncheon on the Grass”**, a reworking of Manet’s composition featuring a  
  male nude with two clothed female figures and a background figure holding a  
  fish.<sup>1</sup>  
- **“Money Is the Root of All Art”**, combining Jasper Johns’s U.S. flag motif  
  with an underlayer of $100 bills.<sup>1</sup>  
- A four-panel sequence referred to as **“The Anti-Warhol”**, in which Warhol’s  
  portrait image transforms across successive panels.<sup>1</sup>  
- **“Ron in My Thoughts”**, English’s reinterpretation of Frida Kahlo’s iconic  
  self-portrait imagery, replacing Kahlo’s face with that of the artist’s wife  
  and substituting Kahlo’s “Third Eye” with English’s self-portrait.<sup>1</sup>

A second review in *The Georgetowner* emphasized English’s process of modifying  
and updating familiar figures—citing influences such as **Picasso**, **Rothko**,  
**Miró**, and **Norman Rockwell**—to reposition well-known compositions within  
new contexts.<sup>2</sup> The publication noted the exhibition as part of the Clark & Co.  
winter program.<sup>2</sup>
