## Exhibition Overview

Ron English presented the exhibition **“Art in Heaven”** at **Wonderlich Gallery**,  
807 Congress, Austin, Texas.<sup>1</sup> The exhibition opened on **February 5** and  
was scheduled to run for **one month**.<sup>2</sup>

According to the accompanying article, the exhibition included new paintings,  
drawings, and photographs in which English used himself as the model for Jesus,  
exploring both traditional Catholic imagery and imagery derived from the  
**Gnostic Scriptures**.<sup>2</sup> The publication also reproduces the artwork  
**“Mary, Jesus and the Little Drummer Boy,”** ©1993.<sup>2</sup>

The contemporary flyer for the exhibition records the title and features imagery  
associated with the show.<sup>1</sup>

The article appears stylistically consistent with arts reporting found in the  
**Austin American-Statesman** during early 1993, but this attribution remains  
a **best-guess hypothesis**, not a confirmed citation.<sup>3</sup>
