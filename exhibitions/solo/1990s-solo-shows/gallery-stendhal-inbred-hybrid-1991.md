## 1991 — *Inbred/Hybrid* — Gallery Stendhal, New York, NY  
**Venue:** Gallery Stendhal, 626 Broadway, 3rd Floor, New York, NY  
**Dates:** September 14 – October 13, 1991  
**Title:** *Inbred/Hybrid*

*Inbred/Hybrid* marked a defining early-1990s presentation of Ron English’s transition from outlaw billboard interventionist to gallery-exhibited painter. The exhibition foregrounded English’s newly developing studio lexicon: paintings that hybridized American cultural icons, mass-media imagery, and art-historical references into dense, symbolic compositions.  

A contemporary feature article in **HYPE Magazine** (written by Mutant, October 1991) describes English’s work from this show as operating on **“multiple conceptual levels simultaneously”** and emphasizes his ability to craft **“meta-characters”** by overlapping and recontextualizing American cultural symbols. <sup>1</sup> The article identifies this hybrid approach — merging cartoon characters, political symbolism, and painterly technique — as English’s emerging signature. <sup>1</sup>

Works documented in the article and attributed to the 1991 Stendhal presentation include:  
- **Sybil War** (1990)  
- **Shark Infested Waters** (1991)  
- **Giving a Dog a Bone** (1991)  
- **Give the Rabbit Some Tricks** (1991)  
- **Bear and the Bull** (1991)  
- **Soupreman** (1991)  
- **The Politics of Creation** (1991)  

HYPE Magazine notes that English often **painted directly over numbered or signed Haring, Kostabi, and Warhol prints**, framing this as a refusal to participate in passive appropriation and instead claiming a more aggressive, interventionist authorship. <sup>1</sup> The article also reaffirms his reputation at the time as a “recidivistic street artist” who had been arrested for altering billboards — contextualizing the gallery exhibition as part of his shift from illicit public work to institutionally recognized fine art. <sup>1</sup>

The surviving **Gallery Stendhal invitation card** confirms the exhibition’s title and date range, and positions the show as a critical moment in English’s formation of the *POPaganda* style that would define his later career. <sup>2</sup>
