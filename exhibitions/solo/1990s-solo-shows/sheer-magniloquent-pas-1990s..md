## Notes

Invitation for the grand opening of **Sheer Magniloquent Pas**, described as “the evening art space in Chelsea,” at **142 W. 26th Street** between 6th and 7th Avenues in Manhattan.  
The card invites guests to a **New Year’s Eve** event on **Monday, December 31**, from **6:30–9:00 p.m.**, “featuring the art of Ron English.” It lists **Baird Jones** as host, a New York nightlife and art-show promoter active from the early 1980s through the 2000s, and provides the gallery phone number **SMP 212-929-2010**.

The building at 142 West 26th Street is a pre-war Chelsea loft structure dating to the early twentieth century, used for residential and creative spaces, which situates the show within the neighborhood’s gallery and studio scene rather than a traditional white-cube venue.
