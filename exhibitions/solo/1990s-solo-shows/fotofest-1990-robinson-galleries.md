## Overview

This solo exhibition at **Thomas V. Robinson / Robinson Galleries** formed part of **FotoFest ’90**, Houston’s city-wide photography biennial. The show focused on Ron English’s photographic practice, including his **composite photographic constructions** and works from the **“American Sideshows”** series.

The works pushed documentary photography toward staged spectacle, blurring the line between straight photographic record and constructed illusion. Within the broader FotoFest context, English’s contribution stood out for its engagement with American roadside culture, billboards and carnivalesque environments that would later become central to his Popaganda universe.
