## Overview

Held at **The Gem** on Melrose Avenue, this one-night solo event brought Ron English’s paintings into the center of Los Angeles’ 1990s alt-culture scene. Sponsored by **Camel Lights** and organized with **01 Gallery**, the exhibition merged art, nightlife, and branded promotional culture—an environment ideally suited to English’s critique of advertising and consumer myths.

The event included:

- A curated selection of paintings  
- A DJ performance  
- An Absolut Vodka–sponsored reception  

This format mirrored English’s broader interest in inserting art into commercial or entertainment spaces as a form of Popaganda, blurring the line between critique and spectacle.
