## Overview

This solo exhibition at **The Art Store** on Downing Street presented a focused selection of Ron English’s early-1990s painting output. The show emphasized his transition from photographic constructions toward **large-scale oil paintings**, pushing themes of pop mythology, cartoon archetypes, and altered Americana.

The exhibition card promoted a body of new canvases that would become foundational to his Popaganda period—works that blended billboard aesthetics, satirical iconography, and painterly subversion of commercial imagery.
