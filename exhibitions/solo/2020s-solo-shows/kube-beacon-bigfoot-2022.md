## Overview

Large-scale solo project at **KuBe Art Center** (part of Ethan Cohen Gallery), presenting **Beacon Bigfoot** as a tongue-in-cheek local mythology. The show combined paintings, sculptural elements, and installation work built around a fictionalized upstate New York “sighting history,” mixing pop-culture parody, regional folklore, and English’s long-developing POPaganda universe.
