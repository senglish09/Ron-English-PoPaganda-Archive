## Overview

*Beyond the Groovy Planet* represents one of Ron English’s earliest documented solo exhibitions in New York. Held at **Levlowe Gallery** in 1980, the show featured “new stuff” by English, likely including early surrealist and psychedelic drawings similar to the illustrated showcard, which depicts multi-headed figures, floating eyes, and cartoonlike distortions that anticipate themes visible in his later Popaganda works.

The event took place on **Friday, November 28**, from **7 to 10 p.m.**, and the hand-drawn promotional card reflects both the underground art energy of the East Village at that moment and English’s emerging fusion of satire, comics, and psychedelic visual vocabulary.

This exhibition predates his billboard interventions and pop-icon subversions of the late ’80s and ’90s, offering an early snapshot of his evolving artistic language.
