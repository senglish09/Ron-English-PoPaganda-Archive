## Overview

In 1988, Midtown Y Photography Gallery included Ron English in a group photography exhibition alongside other emerging photographers. The gallery’s archival records list English as one of the exhibited photographers during the period May–June 1988.  

This show predates English’s later well-known Popaganda work and hints at a lesser-known photographic phase in his career. The exhibition likely presented black-and-white or documentary-style photographs, fitting the gallery’s mission of promoting emerging and experimental photographers.
