## Overview

This 1986 exhibition at **The Salon**, produced by **Stefan Eins** and hosted by **Fashion Moda**, highlighted Ron English’s early engagement with both **street-level interventions** and indoor gallery formats. The show emphasized **showflaps**, **billboards**, and English’s expanding experimentation with public visual space.

Presented in one of the Bronx’s most influential avant-garde art institutions, the exhibition positioned English at the crossroads of institutional art and urban activism. The bold, typographic showcard reinforces the direct, declarative nature of his work during this period, when he was actively subverting advertising systems and exploring the boundaries of cultural messaging.
