## Notes

Solo exhibition at Ivan Karp’s OK Harris Works of Art, presenting Ron English’s early photographic pieces and illusionistic staged scenes. The show extends his investigations into constructed reality—tableaux built in the studio and photographed as “straight” images, without darkroom trickery—placing them in conversation with the gallery’s reputation for conceptual and photo-based work.

As one of English’s first documented New York solo exhibitions, the show helped introduce his POPaganda sensibility to a downtown audience, foreshadowing later moves into billboard interventions and large-scale painting.
